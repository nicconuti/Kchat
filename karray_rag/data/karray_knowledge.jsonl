Diners expect not only a good meal, but also a pleasant experience. Remarkably to chefs, audio plays a significant role. Food is a obviously a big part of a positive dining experience, but the atmosphere of the venue is not any less important. The acoustic of the venue carries more weight than most owner of restaurants think. When diners aren’t able to communicate with each other because of strong reverberations of other conversations and other noise sources, like utensils, dishes and glasses clinking, reflecting off the wall and the ceiling, the entire experience is compromised. At K-array, when we approach the design of a sound system for a dining establishment, we take all these aspects in into consideration. Our Pure Array Technology line array elements guarantee a uniform sound pressure level in the distance meaning that not only the people sitting furthest from the speakers can hear it clearly but also the people sitting closest to the speakers are not disturbed.

{"content": "The Bucharest National Opera House, a cornerstone of Romania’s cultural heritage, recently undertook an audio upgrade project focused on enhancing performances whilst preserving the venue’s historic interiors. Previously, the venue largely relied on rented live sound systems. Oftentimes bulky and not suitable as a permanent solution, these systems risked detracting from the old-world grandeur of the space and potentially distracting audiences. The opera house team collaborated with local distributor and integrator, Senia, to implement a permanent K-array solution, which offers a sleek and unobtrusive design and superior sound quality. “One of the key challenges we faced at the Opera House was balancing the requirements for a high-performance audio system with the need to maintain the original architecture and features of the venue,” reflects Ionut Mavrichi at Senia. “K-array’s slim-profile loudspeakers were carefully selected for their ability to blend seamlessly into the environment.” The main PA system features twelve Kayman-KY102X loudspeakers, with six units per side, ensuring even sound distribution throughout the venue. To provide deep, resonant bass without overwhelming the space, four Thunder-KS3P subwoofers were suspended from the ceiling, with four more units available on dollies for flexible positioning based on the performance and event requirements. Audio coverage at the balcony level is achieved with six additional Kayman-KY102X loudspeakers, ensuring a consistent listening experience for all audience members. Front-fill is provided by the ultra-flexible Anakonda-KAN200+ loudspeakers, which are discreetly mounted to the front of the stage, delivering audio to those sitting closest to the action without interfering with the sight lines. The entire system is powered by Kommander-KA208 and KA104 amplifiers, allowing the venue’s technicians to easily control and monitor system performance through the K-array Connect mobile app. Custom RAL-coloured finishes were applied to the wall-mounted Kayman loudspeakers, blending them into the opera house’s interior design. The addition of a separate Pinnacle system in the lobby offers a consistent audio solution for smaller-scale events and gatherings. The acoustic calibration of the system was a major part of the project, given the venue’s complex sound dynamics, including multiple balconies and highly reverberant surfaces. “Matteo Fanara and I had the opportunity to visit the site and calibrate the sound system in person,” says Paolo Capponi, Product Support Specialist at K-array. “The calibration process presented several challenges, primarily ensuring a well-balanced sound distribution throughout the entire venue and, secondly, achieving homogeneous low-frequency coverage in the audience area without interfering with the orchestra pit and the stage.” To address these challenges, K-array and Senia's team opted for a cardioid-suspended subwoofer configuration, which allowed for better control over low-frequency dispersion whilst minimising unwanted low-frequency energy on stage. Through extensive testing, using multiple measurement microphones across the theatre, the team achieved a precise and linear frequency response, ensuring not only an even and well-balanced sound experience for the audience but also a precise calibration for the technical front-of-house engineers. This project represents a milestone for Romania’s cultural sector, marking the first major audio upgrade at the Bucharest National Opera House since the 1990s. Through modernising the venue’s AV infrastructure, the installation sets a new benchmark for cultural institutions seeking to integrate advanced technology without compromising their own heritage. “The project is a great example of the power of collaboration,” says Mavrichi. “Beyond its technical achievements, our expertise coupled with the support and hands-on calibration of the K-array team has resulted in a very high-quality system that, I am sure, will inspire other cultural venues across Romania.”", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/bucharest-national-opera-house", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.676661"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "At K-array, we are audio innovators, it’s in our DNA. That’s why you’ll find our innovative solutions in large-scale networked AV applications such as stadia, arenas, and other complex environments and the reason we’re trusted by leading sporting venues, such as Viola Park, home of Fiorentina football club. Our products are known for high-quality sound, versatility and radical designs, making them industry game-changers and a top choice for integrators, engineers and designers. Take our Mugello medium format line arrays for example, a powerful system that’s well-suited for large venues, offering excellent sound clarity and coverage. Mugello arrays provide the flexibility needed to adapt to various environments. Whether it's a stadium or a concert hall, its modular design is scalable, meaning it can be perfectly tailored to the size and acoustics of each venue. In large spaces, such as concourse areas, there’s no shortage of acoustic challenges. Our Kayman-KY102-EBS overcomes these challenges with design ingenuity. The EBS stands for Electronic Beam Steering, which precisely adapts the audio to the geometry of any space. The process of steering sound electronically allows coverage to be fine-tuned to reduce unwanted reflections and improve intelligibility, even in challenging and irregular-shaped spaces. Another powerful tool that simplifies the planning and execution of complex audio installations is K-FRAMEWORK 3D software. At the design stage, our software provides detailed acoustic modelling, enabling designers to visualise and predict how the audio system will perform within the space. This is especially useful for stadium projects, where understanding sound propagation and coverage is critical. Uniquely, K-FRAMEWORK lets you seamlessly transition from design to configuration and tuning in one software package. Developed for large-scale networked AV projects, our Kommander amplifier series offers options from 50W to 2,500W per channel. These amplifiers are designed with networking in mind, perfect for expansive venues. We are the first company to adopt Audinate’s ‘Dante Ready’ technology, a feature that allows you to customise the number of Dante channels you need with a software upgrade. You buy the amplifier with no Dante channels and add 2, 4 or 8 as needed. This can lead to substantial cost savings across large projects by eliminating unnecessary channels while allowing for future upgrades. Kommander includes models with two network ports, which can be assigned in a variety of ways, including for Dante primary and secondary audio or for splitting Dante streaming and control over two separate networks. Further enhancing the versatility of K-array's solutions, our amplifiers are compatible with major control systems like Q-SYS, AMX, Control4 and Crestron. The open API ensures easy integration with other systems, making any of our amplifiers a highly adaptable solution for any venue. Another example of our commitment to flexible and efficient solutions is the versatile PRISMA Matrix processing platform. Ideally suited for smaller zones within a large venue, such as a press conference suite, function rooms or hospitality areas, the PRISMA platform integrates local and site-wide audio signals and allows for both local and centralised control. Dante ready, with some models featuring built-in amplifiers, PRISMA offers a comprehensive room solution in a single package. We are proud of our innovations in beam steering, Dante Ready technology, and integrated software solutions. It’s what makes K-array a world leader in large-scale networked projects.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/av-solutions-audio-integration", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.676670"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "The Benjamin Brown Graham Memorial Chapel at Washington University in St. Louis, MO has undergone an extensive audio transformation, marking a significant milestone in its rich history. Spearheaded by project manager Jeff Allen and executed over a meticulous 18-month period, the project prioritized achieving two key goals: seamlessly integrating an audio system to enhance the overall clarity of the chapel while honoring its architectural integrity. Graham Chapel as it’s known on campus features soaring 45-foot ceilings and stone interior walls that posed a unique acoustic challenge. The project began with 12 months of thorough audio analysis to guarantee a perfect match for the chapel's multiple services and events throughout the year. Ultimately, K-array's elegant architectural speaker designs and accurate sound reproduction won over key stakeholders, setting the stage for a brand new audio experience for the 785 person capacity venue. The decision was solidified after an on-site demonstration, where K-array's solutions showcased their ability to provide full coverage sound with exceptional clarity from the front to the back of the chapel as well as the balcony. The slim, discreet speakers from K-array disappeared into the woodwork without visually disrupting the space. Rigorous testing and adjustments during the installation phase ensured optimal performance throughout the chapel, eliminating previous issues with inconsistent volume levels and reverberation. System designer Jeff Allen emphasized the significant improvement in sound clarity, especially at lower volumes eliminating the need to \"push the amps too hard\" and avoiding distortion at higher volumes. Leveraging K-array's K-framework 3, a powerful 3D modeling software, multiple system configurations were tested during the acoustic design phase. The software, alongside additional EASE acoustic modeling data provided by David Bick of McClure Engineering, ensured optimal system performance. At its core, the system consists of ten flown Kayman-KY52 I speakers in a true stereo L/R configuration. For clear coverage in the front, two Python-KP52 I speakers were added for front fill. Rounding out the setup are two compact passive Thunder-KS2P I 18” subwoofers powered by dual 8 channel Kommander-KA208 amplifiers. TSI Global in St. Louis secured the project and brought in engineers Lee Buckalew and Garrison Brown who took charge of rigging, installation, and final commissioning. The project culminated on January 12, just in time for the 37th Annual Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration held at full capacity. The event served as a perfect showcase for the new system's clarity and intelligibility, receiving high praise from attendees. The recent K-array sound system installation at Graham Memorial Chapel is a notable achievement. This new audio technology allows the historic chapel to offer visitors an improved listening experience while respecting and preserving the building's architectural elements. By implementing innovative sound solutions, the chapel can provide a richer and more immersive audio environment without compromising its historic integrity. The K-array system's unique design and advanced features proved to be the perfect fit for the Graham Chapel. The powerful modeling software allowed us to optimize the system for the space, and the final results speak for themselves. Clear, even sound at all volumes creating a truly immersive experience for the audience.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/graham-memorial-chapel", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.676679"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "The luxury boutique Browns changed the course of fashion retail history since it opened in 1970. Today, after fifty years at South Molton Street Browns moved its flagship to 39 Brook Street in the heart of London’s Mayfair. The boutique sits within a Grade II listed building thoughtfully restored and reimagined by revered Milan-based architects, Dimorestudio. When you come into the store, the immediate effect is that you are going to live a unique experience. Browns wants to be a place against the current trends of online fast fashion, without renouncing to contemporary. Creativity and technology offers the visitors an amazing customer experience. The sound within a shop is essential for a perfect shopping experience. The music and the quality of sound subconsciously influence the customers and their purchases. AT&C Professional System Ltd together with 2B Heard had the task to design and install a fully networked, high specification audio system throughout every room. The challenge was to not install the speakers onto any of the walls or ceilings due to the building status, restricting the size and shape, which considerably narrowed the field when it came to selecting a suitable loudspeaker supplier. To accommodate the severe limitations on speaker placement a more sophisticated technological solution was chosen designed to provide tightly controlled dispersion from minimally sized enclosures. Based on positional drawings and initial acoustic predictions, Dave Wooster, director of 2B Heard, specified a selection of K-array speakers that would fit the impossibly small physical spaces from the Lyzard, Truffle and Rumble sub-compact ranges. Subs were hidden into floor vents as again “no visible speakers were permitted”. Every one of the 26 individually Extron controlled zones, including the changing rooms, enjoys the same high level of sound quality from Browns’ own specially curated playlists, produced by the 22 Lyzard-KZ1 mini point source and 72 Lyzard-KZ14 ultra-miniature line array loudspeakers. These are supplemented by 17 Truffle-KTR24 compact subwoofers and 44 Rumble-KU44 compact subwoofers. Distributing faultless audio to so many loudspeakers and to a labyrinth of discrete spaces simultaneously required a creative power amplification infrastructure, which was only made possible by multichannel intelligent amplifiers from Innosonix, another of 2B Heard’s UK distributed brands. But the biggest challenge was striking the right balance between sound coverage and the designers’ aesthetic expectations. Speakers and Subs' physically minimalist profiles and the readily available choice of standard cabinet finishes made this an easy task, with the polished silver treatment allowing the speakers to disappear into the starkly modern décor, and in many cases be completely invisible. A few are finished in black, while in one area, white finished line arrays are fully integrated into the surrounding white ceiling light fixtures. When you walk around the store and hear sweet music, it’s a satisfying result considering that the surfaces are hard and audio-unfriendly. The small Lyzard-KZ14s have the ability to produce good coverage in very wide spaces, and that’s what made the project work. Photo Credits: Bozo Gagovski “The system sounds great. From our perspective as audio purists there have been trade-offs – in certain areas larger, more visible speakers could have given us slightly better coverage, but we stuck to the brief and the client is delighted with the end result. When you walk around the store and hear sweet music all the way through, it’s so satisfying considering that the surfaces are hard and audio-unfriendly. The small KZ14 line arrays gave us the ability to produce good coverage in very wide spaces, and that’s what made this project work – you just can’t use another brand. “The client is really happy,” “Nobody expected that we’d be able to produce audio of this quality without the hardware being visible, and they didn’t think the tiny K-array speakers could do the job.”", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/browns-luxury-boutique", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.676749"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Top restaurant Mr. & Mrs. Bund is located in a historic 19th century building in Shanghai with a 2,700-cubic meter dining room run by world renown chef, Paul Pairet. A K-array system of Kobras was installed when the french eatery first opened in 2018 to match the excellence of the cuisine. System requirements were smooth, ample sound during dining hours, then more powerful acoustics for DJ setups, parties and private events later in the evening. Recent renovations called for more SPL so 18 Python-KP52 line arrays and 4 Rumble-KU210 compact subwoofers ensconced within the walls powered by 4 Kommander-KA24 amplifiers were added. The system, which covers the long length of the dining room uniformly because of its PAT technology, is nearly invisible and blends into the architecture of the restaurant elegantly. The food is amazing, the wine is high-quality and the audio is impeccable.

These vehicles offer all kinds of comfort, from an elegant design to a tranquil zen arrangement that contributes to a serene and relaxing journey and most of all, a comfortable holiday.

The pythons were accompanied by two hidden Rumble-KU210 between the seats to isolate from the noise of traveling vibrations due to the roads, especially outside of the city.

{"content": "Iris bars can be found in the world's gateway cities and has been described as a modern lounge bar bringing an elegant, natural, sensuous and free-spirited experience. Since the first lounge launched in Beirut in 2010, they have been a hot spot for memorable DJ events, cocktails and high profile parties. Iris recently migrated to a new site in Meydan, Dubai. With many signature traits, there is one universal key ingredient that remains a top contributing factor to Iris' major success - great sounding audio. Procom Middle East, local distributor, handled the complete audio integration from design to execution and technical support, and like the other outlets, the venue called on K-array to meet their high expectations. The venue goes beyond the typical late-night DJ sets and provides both a Friday brunch service and live band music at various times, all of which provide a different set of requirements for the audio system. “We had to create an audio system that could cater to in excess of 2,000 customers and that offered enough power and punch for an outdoor venue while still remaining in control of many additional factors such as noise pollution and key design elements” The large open-air space is an unusual shape and is divided into several sections with seating spread all around. There are five bars, high tables, lounges and two areas reserved for VIPs – all centered around a centralized view of downtown Dubai and the Burj Khalifa. Iris suffers from extra restrictive noise regulations. As such, Procom had to pay extra attention in the design to limiting outside transmission: the system was designed by very carefully taking into account noise restrictions in the area, installing a system that has all the coverage and power requirements of a club installation and yet still meet the noise restriction requirements of the area. K-array’s Dragon-KX12 cabinet was central to the project. Outputting up to 132dB, Dragon provided amble SPL for the Iris lounge and ticked all of the boxes in terms of its compact size and sleek aesthetic. The floor area and main bar have been outfitted with four pairs of Dragon-KX12 finished in black to match the venue’s trademark pillars. These have been paired with 18-inch Thunder-KMT18 subwoofers tucked out of sight. The four additional sidebars have been catered to with five Dragon-KX12 and five Thunder-KMT218. Here, Python-KP52 column loudspeaker has also been wall-mounted to provide additional coverage. The large VIP section features twelve Python-KP52 spread uniformly throughout. Four Thunder-KMT18 subwoofers generate the necessary low-end for this area. Away from the main rooftop, Procom integrated twelve Tornado-KT2C speakers into the ceiling for the wine cellar. Iris Dubai’s expansion has seen a complete new indoor venue with sound, light and video. Eighteen Dragon-KX12 passive speakers along with five Thunder-KMT21 and eight Thunder-KMT218 active subs were installed throughout the venue. All controlled by Symetrix, using Prism 8×8 digital signal processor, a control server and xControl external control expander. The DJ monitor system consists of two Thunder-KMT21 and two Dragon-KX12 passive speakers. Noise requirements, level checks, and site readings were taking and used regularly during the design process to ensure the neighboring residential areas would not be disturbed.

{"content": "With so many column audio systems in the market, it is never easy to find the right balance of performance and price in a sea of black boxes. But with all the advantages of its innovative features, compact design and ease of use, the Pinnacle line from K-array can truly separate itself from the pack. Starting with the flexibility to install the catalog in locations such as theatres, small gigs, large events and concerts to large conferences for intelligible audio delivery. K-array and the companies Italian distributor Exhibo, had been on the Vinicio Capossela Tour to present the apex of a strong portable systems catalog with the aim of demonstrating K-array's unique technology within ideal applications that represent the product performing at its best. Vinicio Capossela is an Italian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, strongly influenced by US singer and songwriter Tom Waits. Well-known for being an eclectic representative of independent Italian music, he started his career 30 years ago, winning awards for his music poetry. In 2019 he started his Tour “Ballate per Uomini e Bestie”, with more that twenty dates through the most important theaters in Italy. Theaters are ideal to emphasize the advantages of Pinnacle-KR802. FOH Taketo Gohara, a producer and sound designer who has collaborated with numerous Italian artists and composers was so impressed with the power and sound quality of the flown Pinnacle-KR802 he immediately employed the unique setup for the tour. A main PA consisting of three Pinnacle-KR802 in a suspended 6-meters vertical Kayman-KY102 configuration with six ground stacked Thunder-KMT218 subwoofers has been ideal for ensuring perfect sound coverage and totally intelligible audio without obstructing sight lines given its incredibly slim columns. If you are looking to enhance your theatre sound while improving the experience for your audience then the Pinnacle is just one reason K-array can make a difference in your audio world.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/vinicio-capossela-tour", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.676939"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Opened in 2003, the City of London Academy is one of four City of London corporation sponsored academies. The Academy’s main auditorium is a large purpose-built hall with seating designed for speech, music, assemblies, lectures and large-scale theatrical productions. An elevating audio performance was the purpose of the project, and to make the space capable of the largest theatrical productions while remaining visually minimalistic. For this project it was necessary to avoid installing any large box speakers hanging because there was a weight restriction they needed to observe on the timber beam ceiling structure. AV integrator Torpedo Factory Group proposed a full range, high SPL solution in the form of K-array Kobra line array elements complemented by Thunder subwoofers, and supplied by the Italian audio manufacturer’s UK distributor 2B Heard. A pair of Thunder-KMT18P subwoofers are flown at left and right providing low frequencies, and directly in front of these two long columns of Kobra-KK102 one-meter line array elements complete the powerful and architecturally minimalist PA. Even though it’s a large room this sound system easily fills the space and sounds very natural and open. The sound is clear, crisp and bassy when needed. Each different sound type is accurately reproduced even in this large hall environment. The auditorium at the City of London Academy is a well-designed room with unusually good acoustics. It’s been built with very few parallel walls and correctly installed insulation, and even though it’s a large room the sound system easily fills the space and sounds very natural and open.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/city-of-london-auditorium", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.676946"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "The Auditorium in West Papua was designed by Robert Arnold Sitorus, leader of IAI ( Ikatan Arsitek Indonesia ), commissioned by the mayor of Sorong. He wanted to create something memorable to celebrate the culture and art of West Papua, the native tribes and ancestral routes. The building will be used as a meeting place for the local government, the private sector and the community. For this building a clear sound experience where productivity, a sense of belonging without compromising the architecture and the aesthetic was required. Akustika Swara Indonesia, a K-array distributor, was asked to consult on the multi media offering of the government building. The building area is 1764 square meters, with a capacity of 1500 people. The facilities inside are complete multi media to accommodate education, seminars and critical meetings as well as making visitors feel at home. This newly constructed building has a very strong enigmatic design, a typical reference of West Papua culture where authentic ornaments from the West Papua tribe are displayed, the space however is very large and demands an accurate sound system that could create even coverage throughout the rooms and the main auditorium. Working with main contractor PT. PDKA a solution was devised to install 3 x Kayman-KY102 on each side of the stage with 4 x Thunder-KMT218 while the side fill and stage monitoring consists of one Python-KP102 on both sides. In addition, to create an expansive coverage Thunder-KMT18's were installed on each side of the upper balcony to reach the listeners positioned higher in the auditorium. Since this is the government project this place has to be a benchmark as the performance building in West Papua, so Akustika Swara had to be very careful to calculate and install to achieve the technical target. With this combination the entire space is clear and consistent, there are no muted spots around the room. Good acoustic and good speakers are the perfect combination to make the perception of high clarity sound.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/auditorium-west-papua", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.676953"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Design and Sound in Harmony Introducing the Mark I Lyzard micro-loudspeaker range, where premium audio meets stunning design. Featuring an ultra-sleek, minimalist body crafted from precision-milled aluminum, Lyzard is the perfect choice for discreet installations in intimate environments. With two different lengths and exceptional mid-high-range performance, Lyzard offers a superior sound experience with minimal visual impact. Maximum discretion The size of a chocolate bar, Lyzard speakers blend easily into modern or classic architecture without compromising the aesthetics or the sound, as the design of the speaker integrates naturally into any decor. For permanent installation, a hidden through-hole allows for more secure and theft-proof mounting. Easier connection is also attainable with a 2-pin Phoenix screw terminal designed to hide cables for maximum discreteness. Lyzard is undoubtedly one of the thinnest loudspeakers in the world; a feature that designers use to their advantage. However, for applications where the loudspeakers have to completely disappear, the new two KZ1R I and KZ14R I models allow you to completely recess the body of the speaker into surfaces like plasterboard walls and suspended ceilings. A wide variety of colours and finishes enables the loudspeakers to blend into any environment. The Power of Miniature Say goodbye to conventional and ugly loudspeakers that draw unwanted attention, and embrace the discreet elegance of the Lyzard micro-loudspeaker range, the epitome of premium audio and stunning design, with an even sleeker miniaturized body crafted with exceptionally accurate aluminum millwork. With two lengths of 3.5cm or 10cm, these micro-loudspeakers are perfect for a variety of intimate environments such as retail stores, high-class restaurants, bars, and museums, as the essence of sound lies in being heard, not in being on display. PAT Pure Array Technology Next Generation Line Array Technology The “Pure Array Technology” (PAT) featured in the KZ14 I and KZ14R I models ensures maximum smooth, even coverage with no compromise in sound quality from the front of the space all the way to the back. This is ideal for hospitality environments, where PAT technology ensures background music can be heard at an appropriate level throughout the venue, without the risk of hotspots. Thanks to Pure Array Technology, the powerful sound reproduced by Lyzard-KZ14 I and KZ14R I is extremely natural and transparent and the perfect solution for applications where it is important for music to be present, but not overpowering. ANY STYLE YOU WANT The Lyzard is offered in a semi-matte black or an elegant white finish and can be customized to match any RAL code. Premium brushed or polished stainless steel finishes give the products a chameleon-like ability to reflect surrounding surfaces and blend in with the background. Our 24K gold-plated aluminum is the most luxurious finish - ideal for prestigious design projects and upscale applications. Polished steel, rose and antique gold are the other three premium finishes available for Lyzard. Lyzards are custom manufactured to our exacting standards and subject to our rigorous quality control system in Italy. SNAP and UNSNAP THE GRILLE with a single MOVE Experience the ultimate ease of installation with our magnetic grille loudspeakers. Simply snap and unsnap the grille with a single move, allowing for quick access and maintenance. The sleek and minimalist aesthetic of our magnetic grilles will also enhance the look of any room or environment. A hidden through-hole allows for more secure and theft-proof mounting. Higher impedance, fewer amplifiers The 16Ω impedance allows you to drive more Lyzard loudspeakers from the same amplifier channel. This helps deliver even audio coverage using fewer amplifiers, saving time and money. The Perfect Companion One of the biggest challenges was to make ultra-miniaturized 0.5” transducers that produce high intelligibility and coherent coverage with crystal clear audio. In order to extend the frequency range to 35 Hz, Lyzard should ALWAYS be combined with the Rumble or Truffle subwoofer series, in any application. @ Material that lasts Milled from solid aluminium bars, the Lyzard family of loudspeakers utilises the most durable and resistant materials to protect and conserve the system regardless of the elements, rendering a K-array installation both reliable and long-lasting.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/products/line/lyzard", "content_type": "html", "category": "products", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.676959"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "Founded in 1953 by Prince Rainier III and chaired since 1984 by Prince Albert II, the Yacht Club de Monaco (YCM) combines a taste for sport and a love of the sea. With 2,500 members, the club attracts shipowners, sailors and yacht-lovers from all over the world to its luxurious setting. Resembling a high-tech yacht, this prestigious building it was built with an HEQ (high environmental quality) approach that reflects the spirit of the YCM: open to the world, innovative and concerned with both aesthetics and respect for the environment. Against this backdrop, Yacht Club de Monaco required a complete audio system that would not only align with these values but also provide high-performing sound across various spaces at the club. Italian manufacturer of professional audio solutions, K-array, were chosen to solve this request, with system integration provided by BM Service. “Everything had to be invisible, stylish, yet high-performing, the usual values of K-array,” explains Alberto Gaetti, Product Support Specialist at K-array. “Our loudspeakers were previously installed at the club’s rooftop terrace, so the client was already pleased with our solutions. The next step was to scale the audio system across other key spaces, including indoor and outdoor hospitality spaces, a meeting room and a swimming pool area.” The club maintains a strong commitment to sustainability, using only the highest quality, sustainable materials to ensure the longevity of the building and its interiors. Crafted from stainless steel and aluminium, K-array loudspeakers embody the same principles, making the brand an appropriate choice for the Yacht Club de Monaco. The already existing Rooftop Bar system included six Python-KP102 I and four Python-KP52 I loudspeakers, providing clear and powerful sound. Additionally, four Thunder-KS2P subwoofers ensured a deep bass response, all powered by a Kommander-KA208 amplifier. This system had already proven its ability to maintain a high SPL in a confined area, whilst significantly reducing the sound level outside, therefore a club-wide rollout of K-array products was undertaken. “Working on a prestige project, such as at the Yacht Club de Monaco, is a pleasure,” continues Gaetti. “Their requests for discreet yet powerful audio fit perfectly with the solutions we provide – indeed, our range of unique products excels in harmonising with various interior design and architectural considerations. Furthermore, the IP-rating and weather-resistant finishes of our products are ideal for the marine environment at the YCM.” Offering uninterrupted views of the harbour and the Rock of Monaco, the Aquarama Riva Bar sits on deck 5 of the club. Here, the client required a system to be used largely for background music, with the ability to also provide audio for occasional parties or presentations. This area features two units of Kobra-KK52 I in white, renowned for their slim, half-metre-long form factor and powerful sound projection. Complementing these are two full-range Domino-KF26 loudspeakers, also in white. For the low frequencies, a Rumble-KU210 subwoofer is included. Using K-array’s own mounting hardware, the loudspeakers are fitted to ensure optional sound coverage throughout the space. A Kommander-KA24 amplifier completes the system at the Aquarama Riva Bar. For members searching for a cosy and intimate setting, The Cigar Lounge offers a private space with a relaxing ambience. Here, four compact Lyzard-KZ1s in white and a Rumble-KU44W-2 I subwoofer were installed. An ultra-mini point source loudspeaker, Lyzard blends seamlessly into the room’s aesthetics. The selection of hospitality spaces at the Yacht Club de Monaco extends further to the prestigious 1909 Restaurant, strictly reserved for club members and their guests. Offering a refined dining experience accompanied by panoramic views of the YCM Marina, six Kobra-KK52W and eight Tornado-KT2 loudspeakers, plus a total of 10 Rumble-KU44 I subwoofers, provide high-quality background audio. White finishes to all the loudspeakers ensure that the technology remains discreet. In the outside Sunrise Restaurant, background music and reinforcement for parties was required. “A combination of 11 Domino series loudspeakers with special marine finishes were chosen to provide a reliable sound system that would withstand the elements year-round,” recalls Gaetti. “Whilst they are powerful loudspeakers, suitable for parties as well as background music, the depth of the boxes is still small enough to be carefully integrated into a high-end space without disruption.” A similar system, comprised of Domino and Tornado weather-resistant loudspeakers, was also integrated into the Sportsbar. The focal point for the club’s A-list parties, the Ballroom at Yacht Club de Monaco was integrated with a performance system comprised of two Pinnacle-KR102, one Pinnacle-KR202, and two Pinnacle-KR402 systems. These lightweight, portable systems provide an all-in-one sound solution consisting of K-array’s Thunder subwoofers and Kobra or Python line array elements. “The column array loudspeakers within the self-powered Pinnacle systems offer great performance and easy setup,” confirms Gaetti. “Their ultra-slimline form factor makes them unobtrusive, whilst the interconnecting units allow the team at Yacht Club de Monaco to change the angles of each element, giving them the option to adjust the system for different events in the Ballroom.” Providing clarity of speech was of utmost importance for the club’s Meeting Room area. A place for conferences, presentations and events, a combination of eight Thunder subwoofers and four units of Python-KP102 pure line arrays reproduce the entire vocal frequency range with high intelligibility. Of course, the Yacht Club de Monaco would be incomplete without its spacious sundeck, which includes a swimming pool overlooking the marina. A further high-performance Pinnacle system was chosen for sound reinforcement, ideal for pool parties, whilst providing continued versatility. “Given the combination of both indoor and outdoor spaces, we were conscious in our design to integrate marine-grade products where necessary to ensure that the systems would be resistant to weather and humidity,” says Gaetti. “Through the integration of a full K-array solution, the technical team at Yacht Club de Monaco can access the K-array software suite, such as K-CONTROL and K-CLOUD to have seamless control and management of the system.”", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/yacht-club-demonaco", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.677036"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "Oliver Spencer is one of the UK’s most distinctive men’s fashion designers with a deep commitment to sustainability. Spencer teamed up with world-renowned artist Wolfgang Buttress of The Hive in Kew Gardens fame to create Reverie, a multi-sensory immersive experience in Spencer’s flagship store in Soho London. It's comprised of two facing wooden seats surrounded by living, bee friendly wildflowers. Mirrors adorn the ceiling, while a Haeckels-curated scent suggests flora and beeswax. The design incorporates an intricate soundscape of countryside sounds delivered by an almost invisible K-array audio solution. “We needed loudspeakers that we could place as discreetly as possible, but which would still deliver a very professional performance,” explains Paulie Roche, Senior Audiovisual Engineer for Hoare Lea, the leading UK-based consultancy who designed and installed Reverie’s audio solution. “The visual aspect is so important in Reverie, we needed something with an extremely small physical form.” The solution consists of 12 hard-to-find Lyzard-KZ14 ultra-miniature line array elements nestled in the fauna to simulate birds tweeting and crickets whizzing at the high-end. Two Rumble-KU44 subwoofers are installed under the seats for low-end augmentation to reproduce the hum and rumble of bees. With Reverie now having opened, visitors to the Oliver Spencer store are experiencing it daily. “It’s exciting to be part of such an important project with many high-caliber artists,” says Stefano Zaccaria, VP of Sales & Marketing at K-array. “It reinforces our belief that our audio solutions aren’t just loudspeakers but design elements perfect for architects and designers.” We are very proud of the install. Customers sit down and close their eyes – at the launch it was like musical chairs because everyone wanted to have a go. 2B heard have provided some unique loudspeakers from K-array that can fit into a unique place for a very unique project.

Should you have any questions about your new device please contact K-array customer service at support@k-array.com or contact the official K-array distributor in your country. The Vyper line consists of the flattest speakers in the K-array portfolio and are housed in an elegant and resistant 2-cm-deep aluminum frame that features closely-spaced transducers which boast Pure Array Technology. With closely-spaced cone drivers, the Vyper line demonstrates true line array characteristics: phase coherence, low distortion and focused listening in both the near field and at a distance from the speaker. This Pure Array Technology allows the Vyper to cover venues uniformly and provide long throw. For easier use and integration with other speakers or amplifiers, the Vypers feature selectable impedance and when paired with a subwoofer from the Rumble or Truffle line and powered by a Kommander amplifier with specific presets optimized for the Vyper, the loudspeaker assures excellent coverage of the entire musical frequency range. 6 Vyper-KV USER GUIDE Unpacking Each K-array loudspeaker is built to the highest standard and thoroughly inspected before leaving the factory.

This wiring arrangement is useful in either distributed loudspeaker systems and when stacking multiple Vyper-KV loudspeakers in longer line array configurations. The number of Vyper-KV loudspeakers that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The following table shows the available impedance values for every Vyper-KV model. Always check the loudspeaker impedance before connecting the amplifier. Before driving the loudspeakers ensure to load the proper loudspeaker factory preset on Kommander-KA amplifier Vyper-KV for in-wall installation are not designed to be stacked for making longer line array. A proper jumper wire must be prepared to let the signal exit the former loudspeaker and enter the paralleled loudspeaker preserving the signal polarity. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Before connecting the loudspeaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP.

{"content": "Sysco Productions has created an ambient audio background to support the Imperial War Museum’s Second World War Galleries with near-invisible K-array ultra-compact line arrays. The Second World War Galleries at London’s Imperial War Museum brings to life a war that affected millions of people around the world, a war with which everyone has a personal connection. In order to maximise the realism that IWM’s collection of exhibits so clearly evokes, Sysco Productions pushed the boundaries of AV technology to create an immersive, digitally controlled audio system that takes full advantage of K-array’s ultra-compact Vyper and Lyzard line array attributes to hide these extremely discreet micro line array speakers within the structure of the galleries’ exhibits and provide a supportive ambience without being seen. “The purpose of the audio is to support the messaging of the exhibition without detracting from it or being obtrusive,” said Sysco’s now R&D director Ben Rochlin, who during the design phase was lead engineer on the project. “We had equipped a neighbouring gallery at IWM with conventional 5-inch and 7-inch speaker boxes that sound superb but are slightly more visible within the space. In contrast however, the soundtrack for the Second World War Galleries is predominantly ambient which required a different approach in that we wanted to avoid any possible distraction that could be caused by visual impact of the speakers.” To achieve that aim the Sysco team specified a combination of K-array Azimut systems to be deployed around the gallery, consisting of Lyzard-KZ14 arrays matched with Rumble-KU44 subwoofers and Vyper-KV25 arrays supported by Truffle-KTR26 subwoofers. All the line array speakers are visually discreet and partially concealed within the exhibit structures and so are essentially invisible, helping to build an ambience that enhances visitors’ appreciation of this iconic museum’s experience. The speaker systems are powered by K-array Kommander-KA02 4-channel DSP amplifiers. The 10-cm long Lyzard-K14 arrays in particular play a key role in making the soundtrack come alive, projecting audio confidently despite their diminutive size into some of the gallery’s wider landscapes thanks to their narrow vertical and wide horizontal dispersion, coupled with clearly defined coverage pattern cut-off that provides good separation as you move from one exhibit to another. The backbone of the audio system is fully digital centred around Dante-connected Q-SYS control at its heart, completely dedicated to the job of supplying the best possible quality audio with rock-solid reliability. Alongside archival recordings from the WWII era much of the soundtrack was painstakingly and authentically assembled from modern day real-world clips, some of it captured on location in forests in Belgium with high quality microphones and recorders. All this effort of course demands realism in reproduction as well, and the combination of controlled speaker system dispersion and precise processing has produced a result that impresses while allowing the presence of the technology to simply fade into the background. “It just works,” said Rochlin. “As you walk around the gallery you are immersed in the emotion that the soundtrack evokes, but not particularly aware where it’s coming from – you just don’t think about it. My overall aim was that I wanted it to sound natural without ever really noticing the speakers, and I think that’s what we achieved. I’m really pleased with the outcome; it was a satisfying project for us and it was nice to have the opportunity to really think about the sound system and to be able to design the whole thing without limitations.You have to remember that most of these types of exhibitions are designed by architects. They don’t know the ins and outs of line array technology neither we do know the specifics of architecture, but when you collaborate together you get the most interesting results – and this is a prime example.”", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/imperial-war-museum", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.677287"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Situated on London’s iconic Strand, the Savoy Grill at the prestigious Savoy Hotel recently underwent a complete refurbishment, including its sound system, in the Spring of 2023. The new design aimed to bring the restaurant into the 21st century while retaining its timeless elegance, with luxurious and striking interiors befitting the establishment. The sound system in this restaurant represents a key component in building a memorable dining experience. Background music was to be warm and provide ambience to diners, yet it was critical that the technology would be discreet enough to blend into the interior design. In the main restaurant, distributed Vyper-KV25s have been installed on custom 3D-printed brackets and finished in different RAL colours to provide a discreet solution. K-array’s Pure Array Technology allows for wide sound distribution on the horizontal plane and narrow on the vertical. Therefore, the amount of energy sent towards the ceiling and floor is minimised, resulting in a more focused sound beam that can cover a longer distance uniformly. Rumble-KU44 subwoofers are hidden within the banquette seating, providing a low-end extension from 150Hz to 50Hz. The prestigious Wine Room at the Savoy Grill incorporates K-array’s ultra-discreet Lyzard-KZ14s installed flat to the wall, coupled with a hidden Truffle-KTR24 small form factor subwoofer, providing an excellent solution for audio reinforcement within an intimate environment. Lyzard loudspeakers are one of the smallest models in the K-array product portfolio. Measuring just 10cm tall, this compact size makes it the perfect solution for discreet audio integration.Due to the layout and design of the renowned Chef’s Table area, ceiling-mounted Tornado-KT2 point source loudspeakers were deployed, again coupled with a Truflle-KTR24 subwoofer located underneath the seating. Truffle subwoofers from K-array allow audio reproduction down to 45Hz (-6dB). When it comes to The Savoy, the name alone evokes a vision of the opulence and class of yesteryear. The newly renovated Savoy Grill offers just that but with a background sound system built upon state-of-the-art technology from K-array. Deploying loudspeakers in optimal locations from a sound design point of view, without contradicting any onsite interior design elements, posed a challenge. Multiple coordination meetings with the architect and interior design team allowed us to define the best and most discreet locations and decide on the best RAL colour finishes for the loudspeakers. Working towards a strict deadline and a finite window for installation was another challenging aspect of the Savoy Grill integration which we overcame through effective project management and planning. It was crucial for both us and the client to consider long-term sustainability. To achieve this, we implemented strategies to ensure that the products chosen were of the highest quality and would have an impact far beyond the initial implementation. For that reason we recommended K-array due to their durable and longer-lasting products, made from materials that are easily recyclable at the end of their life, such as aluminium and stainless steel. This choice represents a step towards a more circular and sustainable economy within our industry.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/savoy-grill", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.677296"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Consistently voted one of the world’s best airports by Skytrax, Changi Airport in Singapore recently unveiled its latest attraction: Terminal 2 which now boasts an immersive experience across two installations aimed at recreating the wonders of Singapore’s natural environment. The two multimedia installations, named Digital Sky and Wonderfall were created by multimedia studio Moment Factory, in close collaboration with the design studio BOIFFILS Architectures, and implemented by systems integrators Electronics & Engineering (Wonderfall) and Electro-Acoustics Systems (Digital Sky). Moment Factory also designed the soundscape of both installations and a K-array system was chosen to provide sound reinforcement for this ambitious installation. “For our third collaboration with Changi Airport Group, the trust already established with the client allowed us to push the envelope, both creatively and technically,” explains Fady Atallah, Creative Director at Moment Factory. “With these installations, travellers can immerse themselves in Singapore’s nature with two unique experiences on their journey: an awe-inspiring moment at the Wonderfall and a surprising pause under the digital sky in the Dreamscape.” The Digital Sky, an overhead LED installation above the airport’s airside Dreamscape Garden, required an audio system to create a natural soundscape as visitors move through the space. The soundscape is procedurally generative, meaning that instead of arranging the soundscape on a timeline, it is generated in Audiokinetic Wwise software using a weighted random algorithm. The sound can be modified by changing certain parameters and values in real-time to trigger changes in the density and mix of all its layers. These parameters can also be controlled via an Unreal Engine capsule to respond to changes in the time of day and local weather conditions, creating a unique experience that blends reality with imagination for passengers awaiting their departing flight. On the other hand, the Wonderfall is a landmark feature of the Terminal 2 Departure Hall. Here, a four-story digital waterfall, measuring 18 metres wide and 14 metres high, displays an array of creative waterfall imagery on a 34.4-megapixel LED wall, interspersed with animations and recreations of roaring ocean waves which never fail to stop busy travellers in their tracks. Both installations, whilst clearly of a visual focus, required sound systems that would blend into the space whilst providing high-quality, lifelike soundscapes. A K-array solution was elected due to the performance, reliability and compact design of the brand’s loudspeakers, allowing the integrators to carefully install the products with minimal disruption to the installation design. Furthermore, both the Wonderfall and Digital Sky are set amongst real-world vegetation, so K-array’s IP64-certified loudspeakers make them an ideal choice in the presence of water and humidity. The Wonderfall required considerable audio reinforcement as between ambient interludes, the LED screen displays a 3-and-a-half-minute show consisting of an immersive waterfall animation set to a bespoke piano composition by composer Jean-Michel Blais. Here, the systems integrators opted for a system based around K-array’s Vyper series loudspeakers. These ultra-flat line arrays create minimal visual impact due to their sleek design. 19 Vyper units are supported by two equally slimline Kobra line array elements and four mid-size Domino units. The addition of four, metre-long Python loudspeakers, each with twelve closely spaced 3.15” neodymium magnet woofers, ensures maximum throw and reproduction of the entire vocal range. These loudspeakers are mounted on the surrounding living wall of foliage to ensure minimal visual distraction. Four Rumble subwoofers take care of the low-end frequencies, integrated below the wall, whilst a total of 16 metres of Anakonda ultra-flexible loudspeaker units provide a seamless wall of audio around the bottom of the LED wall. The system is driven by five of K-array’s own Kommander-KA84 amplifiers, providing powerful DSP and integration with the QSC control system. Airside, the Digital Sky at Changi Airport’s Dreamscape enjoys audio through K-array’s Vyper, Kobra and Domino loudspeakers. 19 Vyper units ensure consistent audio coverage, reinforced by six Kobra and eight Domino loudspeakers. Audio playback across the Dreamscape and the Wonderfall is handled via Delta Media Server Infinity by 7th Sense. “By installing the loudspeakers on the ceiling, balcony and hidden in the vertical garden structures, we could localise the sound of individual birds and wildlife in space,” explains Joseph Browne, Interactive Sound Designer at Moment Factory. “This effect was achieved by using the spatial audio tools in Wwise, as well as driven by the location of actors in Unreal Engine. For example, if an eagle flies overhead on the Digital Sky, this triggers a corresponding sound effect in the correct location in the garden sound system.” Recordings of almost 100 local wildlife sounds create an unforgettable immersive nature experience. The placement of the K-array loudspeakers to create an immersive experience in the Dreamscape Garden is demonstrated every 30 minutes in a show that brings the space to life through a three-dimensional orchestral soundscape utilising all 33 loudspeakers. The sound system allows for the individual instruments to be mixed to different locations in the room, resulting in an enveloping musical experience. Whilst the cellos and strings are played from the ceiling, the piano melody comes from the balconies, whilst the mandolin emanates from the garden loudspeakers, literally surrounding passengers with music. From the hypnotising waves of Wonderfall to the tropical haven of the Dreamscape Garden, Moment Factory has utilised the latest innovations in AV technology to reconnect travellers with the natural world. “By blending a dynamic soundscape with visual content, we’ve created a harmonious environment that immerses guests in the Garden City’s natural beauty\" concludes Atallah. “At Changi Airport, travellers can enjoy moments of true tranquillity and wonder in the midst of one of the world’s busiest transportation hubs.”", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/changi-airport", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.677304"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "One of Milan’s leading luxury hotels and part of the Lugarno Collection, Portrait Milano offers guests quintessential Italian hospitality at an address in the heart of the city. Housed in a former Archiepiscopal Seminary dating back to 1565, Portrait Milano is third in the Portrait Collection. Opened in December 2022, the 73-room property recently underwent a large-scale integration of an audio system K-array. “At Portrait Milano, they required a solution that would blend seamlessly with the stylish interiors but provide moderately high SPL,” explains Alberto Gaetti, Project Support Specialist at K-array. “We worked closely with systems integrators, A3 System and Next Domus, to design and implement a system that would complement the guest experience at this luxury hotel.” In total, the project encompassed three unique zones within the hotel, along with a subdivisible meeting space as well as the integration of audio in the hotel spa. The largest space to consider at the Portrait Milano was the 10_11 Bar, Giardino, Ristorante. A long space, divided into three areas for dining, drinks and socialising, 14 units of K-array’s Vyper ultra-flat aluminium line array loudspeakers in a sleek white finish were positioned individually on poles fixed to the walls to provide consistent coverage. With Pure Array Technology built-in, each Vyper unit can cover the venue with uniform and coherent audio. Nine Rumble subwoofers provide low-end reinforcement, either recessed in the walls or hidden under built-in seating. Eight-channel Kommander amplifiers provide power and control of the system. “The main challenge was tailoring the system for moderately high SPL without touching the walls,” continues Gaetti. “The subwoofers have been hidden under the seats, but the Vypers, designed for on-wall or in-wall installation, have been mounted on sleek poles off-the-wall, because of the acoustic finish of the wall surface.” At the heart of the property lies the Porticato, a long, narrow outdoor space with original stone columns. Here, a continuation of the Vyper and Rumble combination, with eight and four of each, respectively, are installed in loudspeaker/subwoofer pairs on the interior wall, interspersed with individual Vyper units. The two remaining hospitality areas, an open-air dining area and its adjoining garden, required a different approach. “For maximum audio coverage with a wide dispersion we opted for 14 Tornado point-source loudspeakers,” explains Gaetti. Four Rumble subwoofers, fixed to the ceiling beams were also installed. In the garden, a system composed of four Kobra, metre-long stainless steel line array elements also featuring Pure Array Technology, and a further three Rumble subwoofers create an immersive soundscape. Portrait Milano also offers a sub-divisible events room to its guests. Users of the space can either enjoy a unique, spacious room or separate the space into three private spaces using two sliding walls. In the smallest room, a lighting and audio solution, RAIL by KSCAPE, delivers an innovative and modern all-in-one solution. For the other rooms, a combination of Vyper and Kobra loudspeakers with Rumble subwoofers offer versatile options for presentations and audio for video conferencing. “In summary, each of the three rooms has its own sound system with individual room inputs,” explains Gaetti. “In case the room is needed for larger meetings, the users can easily configure the control system to ensure the loudspeakers work together as a single system.” Playing host to ‘The Longevity Suite’, the most advanced biohacking and anti-ageing brand in Europe, Portrait Milano’s Longevity Spa fuses the latest technology with a holistic approach to wellness. Comprising a pool and wet area plus a gym and treatment rooms nestled beneath the ancient vaults of the property, this zone required an audio system that would provide high-quality sound without detracting from the carefully curated interior design. “K-array Lyzards are ideal for these environments,” continues Gaetti. “The ultra-compact design of the Lyzard-KZ1 and Lyzard-KZ14 models integrate seamlessly with their surroundings.” A total of 10 Lyzard units are installed across the spa reception area and adjoining corridors, including recessed models which allow for direct integration into walls and cavities for a flawless finish. Rumble subwoofers, supplied in a matching white finish, complete the background audio systems. In each private treatment room, individual GC6 ceiling loudspeakers from K-array group brand, KGEAR, provide clients with an immersive experience through the integration of the loudspeakers directly above the treatment bed. “For the pool area, we opted for metre-long Vyper units due not only to their discreet form factor, but also their durability as they can withstand the higher levels of humidity present in this zone,” confirms Gaetti “Eight of these units, installed flush against the walls of the pool area, are paired with four Rumble subwoofers, completing a system that will provide consistent audio to enhance this calming space.” The system at the Longevity Spa is driven by K-array’s own Kommanader amplifiers in KA18 and KA28 models. “There are many benefits to powering the system with Kommander units,” says Gaetti. “The use of K-framework3 acoustic simulation software is a powerful tool for sound system designers and allowed us to design a system that pairs the project’s aesthetic requirements with maximum performance. Furthermore, Kommander DSP enabled fine-tuning of the system and correction of imperfections in the room to deliver the best possible sound that exceeds client expectations.” Portrait Milano is now equipped with a complete audio system that will enhance the experience of its guests, whether dining in the restaurant, enjoying an aperitivo in the garden or indulging in a treatment at the Longevity Spa. At Portrait Milano, they required a solution that would blend seamlessly with the stylish interiors but provide moderately high SPL", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/portrait-hotel-milano", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.677320"}, "embedding": null}

Switch on the music and enjoy! 8 Vyper-KV USER GUIDE Wiring For easy connectivity and link, the Vyper-KV line array loudspeakers feature Euroblock 2 pin inlets, namely for Phoenix 2,5/ 2-ST-5,0 flying plug. Caution must be taken when connecting the loudspeaker cable to the flying connector in order to match the signal polarity: please refer to the label on the rear panel of the loudspeaker for the correct matching. For a cable run of up to 5 m (16.4 ft) use wire gauge of 0,75 mm2 (18 AWG) minimum. For longer cable runs a wider gauge is recommended. 1. Set the proper speaker cable length for connecting the loudspeaker to the amplifier; 2. Connect the speaker cable to the two terminals connector, taking care to respect the signal polarity; 3. Set the proper impedance value according to the loudspeaker configuration and amplifier model. 4. Plug the speaker cable to the signal connector on one loudspeaker end; In application demanding IP65 devices: A. Cut a small aperture on the IP65 connector sealing plate’s rubber; B. Let the speaker cable passing through the IP65 connector sealing plate’s rubber; C. Connect the speaker cable to the two terminals connector, taking care to respect the signal polarity; D. Set the proper impedance value according to the loudspeaker configuration and amplifier model. E. Remove the connector plates from the loudspeaker back panel; F.

This wiring arrangement is useful in either distributed loudspeaker systems and when stacking multiple Vyper-KV loudspeakers in longer line array configurations. The number of Vyper-KV loudspeakers that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The following table shows the available impedance values for every Vyper-KV model. Always check the loudspeaker impedance before connecting the amplifier. Before driving the loudspeakers ensure to load the proper loudspeaker factory preset on Kommander-KA amplifier Vyper-KV for in-wall installation are not designed to be stacked for making longer line array. A proper jumper wire must be prepared to let the signal exit the former loudspeaker and enter the paralleled loudspeaker preserving the signal polarity. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Before connecting the loudspeaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP.

This wiring arrangement is useful in either distributed loudspeaker systems and when stacking multiple Vyper-KV loudspeakers in longer line array configurations. The number of Vyper-KV loudspeakers that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The following table shows the available impedance values for every Vyper-KV model. Always check the loudspeaker impedance before connecting the amplifier. Before driving the loudspeakers ensure to load the proper loudspeaker factory preset on Kommander-KA amplifier Vyper-KV for in-wall installation are not designed to be stacked for making longer line array. A proper jumper wire must be prepared to let the signal exit the former loudspeaker and enter the paralleled loudspeaker preserving the signal polarity. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Before connecting the loudspeaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP.

{"content": "When the client is a true audiophile, so much so that they regularly invite world-famous DJs to play in their home, then, a premium, high-quality audio system is a must. And, when that home also features glass walls, double-height ceilings, a series of unique design features and an outdoor party area that has to cope with the wide temperature fluctuations of the Canadian climate, then finding the right audio solution presents significant aesthetic and performance challenges too. This was the sizeable task facing the home technology project team of AVI Consulting, Niagara Falls-based integrator, Design Electronics and 5 Element Sales & Marketing at an awe-inspiring Ontario home, known as the Iceberg. It’s an incredible property, with a set of demanding AV requirements, that has driven the team to new heights, according to Glen Amell, chief design officer for Design Electronics. “This transformative creation invites you to redefine modern living through technological sophistication and artistic refinement, transcending boundaries and leaving an indelible mark on luxury AV and technology.” For the most challenging spaces within the property, the team quickly decided that K-array was the only speaker brand capable of delivering the incredible audio performance required whilst meeting the interior goals of the client. Nowhere is this more clearly the case than in the Iceberg’s stunning basement nightclub. Measuring approximately 18m in length and 4m width, this area featured hard surfaces and clean, modern lines, presenting a challenging canvas for any audio system. The team specified four Python-KP102 pure line array speakers and three Rumble-KU212 passive subwoofers for the nightclub which routinely hosts world-renowned DJs and all-night parties. At 1m long and just 89mm wide, with twelve closely spaced neodymium magnet woofers to produce a really long throw, the Python speakers not only pack a real audio punch for this space but their sleek, linear design also blends well with the futuristic party room vibe. They can reproduce the entire vocal frequency range with high intelligibility, starting from 120Hz and integrate with the Rumble subwoofers to provide excellent coverage of the entire musical frequency range. Elsewhere, the contemporary look and feel carries on throughout the Iceberg, notably in the office and dining room where excessively high ceilings and modern materials also drove the use of K-array. In the dining room, the walls are glass and the ceiling is high so a traditional architectural speaker was out of the question. Instead, four Vyper-KV52 II ultra-flat passive loudspeakers and four hidden Rumble-KU26s subs are fitted to give the perfect soundtrack for any occasion. The office has similar challenges, thanks to its two-storey-high ceiling. Here, K-array Vyper-KV52 II speakers were again called upon to deliver effortless, pristine audio throughout the space. Purpose-designed for elegant, super-discreet installations, the Vyper-KV52 II measures just 500mm height x 40mm width x 22mm depth and is perfect for this type of clean, bracketless application on any flat surface. It’s not just inside where K-array has proven to be the right choice. In the stunning, minimalistic garden, which includes a pool, cabana, waterfalls, fire features and an underground botanical garden, the team opted for four weather-resistant K-array linear speakers, two either side of the two TVs in the cabana, along with concealed subwoofers. This time Kobra-KK52s were paired with Rumble-KU210s. In addition, six larger Kobra-KK102s and four Rumble-KU212s are hidden behind bushes and trees to optimize coverage throughout the garden. The outdoor system is used year-round for parties and gatherings, often featuring professional music, dance and theatrical performances. The setup, which has been operational for almost a year, also features a full Crestron control system which handles the multiple zones of audio throughout the property. Lutron lighting and shading control has been chosen to further enhance the aesthetic. “Our adaptability to the homeowner’s multifaceted lifestyle, spanning professional work to DJ performances, highlights our responsiveness,” Amell says. “The precision-engineered DJ area, hosting world-renowned DJs, exemplifies our commitment to peak performance while maintaining the residence’s aesthetic. Our audio solution is only achievable thanks to the exceptional products provided by K-array.” Photos by Rohan Dayal Iceberg's basement nightclub Prova Testo un pò più lungo con ritorno di paragrafo Dining Room Prova Testo un pò più lungo con ritorno di paragrafo CABANA Prova Testo un pò più lungo con ritorno di paragrafo HEDGES Prova Testo un pò più lungo con ritorno di paragrafo Our adaptability to the homeowner’s multifaceted lifestyle, spanning professional work to DJ performances, highlights our responsiveness.

{"content": "One year after the passing of Thailand's monarch, King Bhumibol, his cremation was to be carried out in a magnificent and respectful ceremony according to ancient traditions. The crematorium site spans more than eight hectares - the equivalent of more than 10 football pitches - located next to the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Given the importance of prayer and song, the government's project inspector, Srimuang Jusntasri asked for three basic requirements of the audio: the sound equipment must perfectly blend in with the structures on site, if visible at all, must be heard everywhere at all times and must sound perfect. The most important and visible structure was the Phra Merumas (Royal Crematorium), a heavily-decorated golden structure with nine spires, the tallest at more than 50m of which housed the cremation pyre itself. As very few people set foot in it, high-output audio wasn't needed, however seamless integration was top priority, rendering the ultra-flat Vyper-KV52 and mini Lyzard-KZ14 line array elements customized in 24K gold perfect for the installation. Additional Vyper-KV50 line arrays customized in white provided in-fill near the entrance. Outside, at columns supporting the roof of the Royal Merit-Making Pavilion, as well as on walls of other pavilions facing the crematorium, Kobra-KK102 line arrays in white were installed to cover the area. \"These speakers are the best fit for this environment,\" explained Tony Puytrakool from Vision One distributors. \"They were instantly accepted by the government's public relations department and fine art department; they are weather-resistant, have the right dispersion and reproduce the sound sources exceptionally.\" In such environments, we do not want to see equipment like lighting fixtures or loudspeakers, if possible. These gold-plated units, however, are an acceptable solution thanks to the matching of the surrounding surfaces.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/royal-cremation-ceremony", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.677508"}, "embedding": null}

This wiring arrangement is useful in either distributed loudspeaker systems and when stacking multiple Vyper-KV loudspeakers in longer line array configurations. The number of Vyper-KV loudspeakers that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The following table shows the available impedance values for every Vyper-KV model. Always check the loudspeaker impedance before connecting the amplifier. Before driving the loudspeakers ensure to load the proper loudspeaker factory preset on Kommander-KA amplifier Vyper-KV for in-wall installation are not designed to be stacked for making longer line array. A proper jumper wire must be prepared to let the signal exit the former loudspeaker and enter the paralleled loudspeaker preserving the signal polarity. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Before connecting the loudspeaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP.

{"content": "Luxury LED for Home is a pre-packaged high-end home cinema that targets consumers who prefer a unique entertainment experience, designed in collaboration with electronics powerhouse Samsung contributing its latest IF Series screens and luxury furniture designers Vismara adding its theater-style seating and custom-made sound proofing panels. Delivering the cinema’s high-end audio technology are K-array loudspeakers with Trinnov’s A/V processors to offer a new approach to surround sound. The incredibly discreet and elegantly designed loudspeakers are positioned all around the room including the ceiling. Combined with the Trinnov processor which optimizes the music track, movie dialog and sound effects to provide spectacular sound, this immersive 3D audio not only provides high-quality sound performance but renders watching any kind of A/V content a true sensorial experience. To meet the project’s design challenges of limited real estate for loudspeakers, K-array employed a sound system comprised of the Vyper-KV52 loudspeakers distributed on both sides of the massive display as Left and Right main sources. Its innovative Pure Array Technology ensures complete coverage of every row of the theater seating with a consistent and powerful sound field without disrupting the visual layout and room design. A Central audio channel was also constructed with just a pair of horizontal Vyper-KV52 loudspeakers placed at the top and at the bottom of the display. The loudspeakers are optimized to enable the audience to perceive the sound coming from the very center of the scene. The 3D immersivity of the sound field is guaranteed by additional eight full-range Domino-KF26 loudspeakers with four dedicated to managing the sound field on the horizontal plane in a 360° around the audience while the other four Domino-KF26 loudspeakers are installed on the ceiling, providing elevation and spatiality to the sound. - Showrooms in Monaco and Milan both house the entire Luxury for LED package.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/luxury-home-cinema", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.677603"}, "embedding": null}

Should you have any questions about your new device please contact K-array customer service at support@k-array.com or contact the official K-array distributor in your country. The Vyper line consists of the flattest speakers in the K-array portfolio and are housed in an elegant and resistant 2-cm-deep aluminum frame that features closely-spaced transducers which boast Pure Array Technology. With closely-spaced cone drivers, the Vyper line demonstrates true line array characteristics: phase coherence, low distortion and focused listening in both the near field and at a distance from the speaker. This Pure Array Technology allows the Vyper to cover venues uniformly and provide long throw. For easier use and integration with other speakers or amplifiers, the Vypers feature selectable impedance and when paired with a subwoofer from the Rumble or Truffle line and powered by a Kommander amplifier with specific presets optimized for the Vyper, the loudspeaker assures excellent coverage of the entire musical frequency range. 6 Vyper-KV USER GUIDE Unpacking Each K-array loudspeaker is built to the highest standard and thoroughly inspected before leaving the factory.

This wiring arrangement is useful in either distributed loudspeaker systems and when stacking multiple Vyper-KV loudspeakers in longer line array configurations. The number of Vyper-KV loudspeakers that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The following table shows the available impedance values for every Vyper-KV model. Always check the loudspeaker impedance before connecting the amplifier. Before driving the loudspeakers ensure to load the proper loudspeaker factory preset on Kommander-KA amplifier Vyper-KV for in-wall installation are not designed to be stacked for making longer line array. A proper jumper wire must be prepared to let the signal exit the former loudspeaker and enter the paralleled loudspeaker preserving the signal polarity. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Before connecting the loudspeaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP.

This wiring arrangement is useful in either distributed loudspeaker systems and when stacking multiple Vyper-KV loudspeakers in longer line array configurations. The number of Vyper-KV loudspeakers that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The following table shows the available impedance values for every Vyper-KV model. Always check the loudspeaker impedance before connecting the amplifier. Before driving the loudspeakers ensure to load the proper loudspeaker factory preset on Kommander-KA amplifier Vyper-KV for in-wall installation are not designed to be stacked for making longer line array. A proper jumper wire must be prepared to let the signal exit the former loudspeaker and enter the paralleled loudspeaker preserving the signal polarity. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Before connecting the loudspeaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP.

{"content": "The Vyper-KV102 II is an ultra-flat passive loudspeaker comprised of sixteen 1” neodymium magnet transducers each, housed in an elegant yet sturdy aluminum chassis, with a new frameless chassis designed for very elegant discreet installations, perfect for a clean bracketless application on any flat surface. The sixteen closely-spaced cone drivers provide true line array characteristics: phase coherence, low distortion and focused listening in both the near field and at a distance from the speaker. Two different values of impedance (8Ω – 32Ω) allow to connect up to 8x Vyper-KV102 II loudspeakers at 32Ω impedance to the same 4Ω amplifier output channel, which eliminates the need for 70V lines for wide distributed installed systems where pristine sound, intelligibility and elegance are mandatory.

This Pure Array Technology allows the Vyper to cover venues uniformly and provide long throw. For easier use and integration with other speakers or amplifiers, the Vypers feature selectable impedance and when paired with a subwoofer from the Rumble or Truffle line and powered by a Kommander amplifier with specific presets optimized for the Vyper, the loudspeaker assures excellent coverage of the entire musical frequency range. 6 Vyper-KV USER GUIDE Unpacking Each K-array loudspeaker is built to the highest standard and thoroughly inspected before leaving the factory.

This wiring arrangement is useful in either distributed loudspeaker systems and when stacking multiple Vyper-KV loudspeakers in longer line array configurations. The number of Vyper-KV loudspeakers that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The following table shows the available impedance values for every Vyper-KV model. Always check the loudspeaker impedance before connecting the amplifier. Before driving the loudspeakers ensure to load the proper loudspeaker factory preset on Kommander-KA amplifier Vyper-KV for in-wall installation are not designed to be stacked for making longer line array. A proper jumper wire must be prepared to let the signal exit the former loudspeaker and enter the paralleled loudspeaker preserving the signal polarity. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Before connecting the loudspeaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP.

{"content": "The \"Rocco B. Commisso Viola Park\" stands proudly as the new sustainable sports center for ACF Fiorentina in Bagno a Ripoli, Florence. Nestled amidst the picturesque Florentine hills, Viola Park epitomizes the fusion of entrepreneurship and sport, and it dedicates time to nurturing the next generation of Viola footballers. Viola Park, spanning 26 hectares, represents the largest sports center in Italy and ranks among the largest in Europe. It not only houses training fields but also encompasses all essential service structures for the team. The facilities within Viola Park include: - 20 ACF Fiorentina teams - 12 regulation pitches, including natural, hybrid, and mini football school pitches, along with a dedicated goalkeeper training pitch - Two stadiums accommodating 4,500 spectators, 3000 at “Curva Fiesole” and 1500 at “Davide Astori” - Four gyms with over 130 training stations and a spacious rehabilitation gym - 12 pavilions - 75 rooms offering accommodation for 116 beds - Medica center and wellness center featuring a 25-meter swimming pool, two vascular pools, cryotherapy, sauna, and Turkish bath Professional Show is the systems integrator for audio/video/lighting systems across Viola Park. After hearing a demo of our systems at the Artemio Franchi Stadium, ACF Fiorentina chose us as the audio partner. Our quality and performance impressed them, especially regarding the size/ performance ratio. We tested The Pinnacle-KR402 II for the main seats. We ensured good coverage with a few column elements and an adequate SP with the portable system. We then developed a fixed-install solution for scalability and discrete visual impact. For the Artemio Franchi Stadium, we proposed the K-array Firenze-KH7 steerable line array element: rethinking the system for the smaller stadium at the Rocco Commisso Viola Park in Bagno a Ripoli, Florence, we needed to adhere to the architectural constraints, leading us to adopt an alternative approach for sound reinforcement. We orchestrated the audio system installation in the “Curva Fiesole” stadium alongside Professional Show. The system, featuring seven GS18 subwoofers and 21 KGEAR GH12 speakers for each bleachers, were meticulously positioned to harmonize with the stadium's architectural profile, showcasing a marriage of acoustic technology and design. Drawing from our experience with the K-array Mugello-KH2 I step array configuration and leveraging the KGEAR GA46 amplifiers DSP capability, we designed an unusual loudspeaker reinforcement system that matches the aesthetics of the mini stadium and guarantees an even coverage of the stands with moderately high SPL. The conventional method for installing the loudspeakers in the stadium involves suspending the sound sources down to the coverings and beams. For the Rocco Commisso Viola Park mini stadium, the request was to install an invisible loudspeaker system without a column array or other technical elements breaking the straight lines of the ceiling of the stands coverings. We developed a quasi-horizontal step array of KGEAR GH12 loudspeakers to adhere to the architectural constraints. Thanks to their mechanicals, the KGEAR GH12 loudspeakers have been chosen for their high SPL emission and ease of installation. For each of the seven loudspeaker clusters, the three KGEAR GH12 in-step array configurations are evenly distributed under the ceiling so that the meticulous positioning compensates for the covering's up-tilt angle. Each KGEAR GH12 is angled downward with defined tilting angles: for maximising coverage across the listening area, the loudspeaker emissions are aligned with precise delay and equalisation. Each loudspeaker cluster comprises a KGEAR GS18 subwoofer to complete the system frequency response. The sound reinforcement system is designed to provide high SPL for use during football matches for speech and music. The Events Pavilion's audio system, comprising our components, was strategically installed to maintain Viola Park's aesthetic standards while delivering superior acoustic quality. The system includes eight Python-KP102 I speakers, two Thunder-KS3P I subwoofers, and eight Rumble-KU212 subwoofers discreetly integrated into the wooden walls. The four two-meter-long Python-KP102 I line arrays are strategically positioned to ensure deep coverage from few source points. The Rumble-KU212 are distributed low-frequency sources used for everyday background music. During events and parties, the Thunder-KS3P I provides engaging low-end high SPL. The bars within the \"Curva Fiesole\" stadium, named \"Maglia Viola\" and \"Il Giglio\" feature bespoke audio systems crafted with our expertise. Each bar boasts a combination of four Vyper-KV102R II speakers and eight Rumble-KU26 subwoofers, managed seamlessly through the QSC Audio control system, ensuring optimal sound control for guests. We designed the initial configuration of the “Maglia Viola” and the “Giglio” Bar for moderately high SPL background music and radio commentary of football matches, given the tremendous success of the venues, which can accommodate up to 400 people during very popular events. We also improved the football matches radio commentary with eight Vyper-KV102R II speakers for reinforcement. At this time, four Pinnacle-KR402 II portable systems were added to the resident sound reinforcement system during clubbing nights at “Maglia Viola” and the \"Giglio\" Bar. Viola Park, Fiorentina's new home, is a testament to innovation and dedication to sport and technology. Through strategic partnerships and meticulous design, the integration of cutting-edge audio systems elevates the experience for players, spectators, and visitors alike, ushering in a new era of excellence in sports facilities. It was a real pleasure to discover that Fiorentina had already chosen K-array as the brand for audio systems of the Viola Park. Professional Show has been actively collaborating with K-array for several years, in numerous corporate installations in Italy, so it was a simple and winning solution for both Fiorentina and both companies to find ourselves together in yet another great project. I strongly believe that the work carried out at the Viola Park has further sealed and strengthened the partnership between Professional Show and K-array not only for various corporate installations but also, in the near future, in the broadcast area and in the flight simulation.”", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/viola-park-sport-centre", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.677855"}, "embedding": null}

This wiring arrangement is useful in either distributed loudspeaker systems and when stacking multiple Vyper-KV loudspeakers in longer line array configurations. The number of Vyper-KV loudspeakers that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The following table shows the available impedance values for every Vyper-KV model. Always check the loudspeaker impedance before connecting the amplifier. Before driving the loudspeakers ensure to load the proper loudspeaker factory preset on Kommander-KA amplifier Vyper-KV for in-wall installation are not designed to be stacked for making longer line array. A proper jumper wire must be prepared to let the signal exit the former loudspeaker and enter the paralleled loudspeaker preserving the signal polarity. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Before connecting the loudspeaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP.

{"content": "Founded in 1953 by Prince Rainier III and chaired since 1984 by Prince Albert II, the Yacht Club de Monaco combines a taste for sport and love of the sea. With 2000 members, the club raises the art of nautical living and attracts shipowners, sailors and boaters from all over the world in a luxurious setting. An international meeting point, the YCM is based in a building resembling a high-tech ocean liner, designed by Lord Norman Foster of Foster & Partners and fitted out by Jacques Grange. It was built in an HEQ (high environmental quality) approach and reflects the spirit of the YCM: open to the world, innovative, concerned with both aesthetics and respect for the environment. It hosts many prestigious events throughout the year due to the nature of its reputation. On September 22nd 2020, the Secretary General of the YCM, Bernard d’Alessandri, organized a video conference on the theme of \"Hydrogen, a credible alternative to diesel\". Prince Albert II, the famous Swiss explorer-adventurer Mike Horn and more than 150 people attended the conference and a further 200 attendees from around the world connected online. The equipment required for this multimedia event had to meet two challenges; first of all, it was necessary to preserve the harmony of the decor and avoid traditional speakers, which were too bulky and aesthetically pleasing, then the wireless microphones had to work without being disturbed by the numerous HF emissions present in the surroundings. The company M3 (Monaco Marina Management), responsible for the organization of the event, called on K-array’s French distributors AEI for the high quality audiovisual installation of this conference. The solution was perfect for the slim, lightweight speakers of K-array. Compact and refined, the Pinnacle-KR402 systems are discreetly integrated into the room, without altering the decor. Lightweight and flexible, the Anakonda speakers placed in reinforcement on the stage also acted as stage monitors. While remaining perfectly discreet, the installation ensured seamless coverage, and uncompromising sound quality, comfortable with the event and the venue.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/yacht-club-monaco", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.677997"}, "embedding": null}

The roof terraces of both sections have pools that provide panoramic unparalleled views of the capital overlooking landmarks such as El Capitolio, the Paseo de Prado, and the Gran Teatro della Habana. The decor of the colonial lobby is the epitomy of 5-star–hotel classic elegance so it was imperative to the management to select an audio system that would integrate seamlessly, tasking Cuba distributor Beta Music with the challenge. The team selected the most flexible, discreet audio available on the market: the K-array Anakonda. A system of 10 Anakonda-KAN200 line arrays was fitted in a white sock to match the interior and hide cabling then installed within the crown molding at base of the first floor balcony. The Anakondas alternated between 9 compact Rumble-KU44 subwoofers, also in white, to create an invisible immersive sound field of homogenous quality audio in an unobtrusive form. The system was driven by a Kommander-KA84 amplifier.

{"content": "“Sztárban sztár” (A Star Within a Star) is a singing competition broadcast on Hungary’s TV2 where undiscovered talent is transformed into international performers with the help of makeup artists and hair stylists who help them look confusingly similar to the original star. Contestants impersonate these pop stars by performing the artists’ tops hits to win votes from a 4-member jury and the viewers. The winner of the show is crowned “Hungary's Most Versatile Performer”. For the in-studio audio Ádám Somodi’s, Chief Sound Engineer at TV2 needed a system in the studios to complement the existing live sound concert equipment used for musical performances and reproduce the dialog in between performances among the jury and singers to avert playback into his/her own microphone for the L-C-R main PA. To avoid blanketing the jury of judges with the main PA when any of its members speak since all the microphones would reproduce the sound, Somodi employed a 24-meter-long line of continuous audio in the form of 12 Anakonda-KAN200 built into the table which he shifts to after the performances. In the another TV2 studio, the big challenge was that the performers used omnidirectional microports and their audio is delivered back to the studio where the audience and panel of judges sit. With a system of 6 Anakonda-KAN200 loudspeakers which formed a 12-meter-long line, the sound team was able to position these speakers so that the audience can appreciate the high-quality audio but neither they nor the cameras know where they are located. In addition, 24 Python-KP102 loudspeakers were selected for their discreetness as these can be placed anywhere easily: in any small gap that the scenery allows, onto bridges or barriers and under the chairs. For the low end, 8 Thunder-KMT21 subwoofers were employed The entire system can be directed so well that almost nothing can be heard sideways and backward, thus the atmosphere microphones have a perfect position behind the speakers. The sound of the audience can be heard through these microphones much more than the PA system’s sound although members of the audience perceive it much louder than their own sound. I been working on the broadcast as a live sound engineer since 2006. I've been looking for a solution for years to create a live concert experience in the studio without interfering with other equipment, lights and cameras, and at the same time fitting into the broadcasted sound. After a long search, finally we have found the features we needed so much in K-array’s products: compact sound sources that could be easily positioned in the scenery, while being accurately controllable and even programmable.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/star-tv2-broadcast", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678016"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "Florence celebrated a historic double anniversary in 2014 of the city's booming industrial economy: 60 years since the gas supplier ENI purchased an old iron foundry, saving the factory from closure and enshrining the birth of Nuovo Pignone in 1954, and 20 years after the acquisition of Nuovo Pignone by General Electric in 1994 to create GE Oil & Gas, the leading manufacturer of gas turbines and compressors. The celebration of these anniversaries took place at the Stazione Leopolda in Florence, Italy with prime minister Matteo Renzi in attendance where he and highly influential members of the technology industry and the general public could see exhibits of photos of the companies' history and displays of their innovative technologies, past and present. Although beautiful and renown for its industrial architecture, the vast, old train station produces a significant amount of noise reverberation so event organisers Mediacross teamed up K-array to deliver an audio solution to confront these challenges. One of the displays included an impressive 3D hologram of a new generation turbine created by the MMG Multimedia Meeting Group that was accompanied by hanging two portable Pinnacle-KR402 systems that included clusters of four Python-KP102 line arrays paired with two Thunder-KMT21 subwoofers per side. An Anakonda-KAN200+ further supported the video projection. MMG hailed the K-array systems for their easy, plug and play set up as well as the quality of sound. eVideo was also a constant element of the display layout throughout the venue; either with an informational and communicative purpose.

{"content": "The Basilica Santissima Annunziata is a monumental church in Florence, Italy dedicated to the Virgin Mary with origins dating as far back as 1081. The ornate basilica includes original frescos that beautifully depict the Miraculous Annunciation. When the administration of Florence decided to overhaul the AV at Santissima Annuziata, they requested an audio installation that would ensure optimal coverage of all areas of the basilica where religious ceremonies are held, which became the most complex aspect of system requirements given that the services are celebrated at different locations throughout the church. Another problematic factor of the Santissima Annunziata, which is typical of places of worship, was the excessive reverberation: the very high ceiling and the walls lacking a specific acoustic treatment abundantly reflect the audio. Officials realized that a unique solution employing compact loudspeakers would be needed and, therefore called upon K-array given their success on past projects. K-array proposed a system for into two independent sections: one to address the high altar in the direction of the seating and a rear system that is directed from the chapel of the SS Annunziata in the opposite direction, using slim line arrays to focus the sound beam in the vertical plane providing a long throw of the sound waves without dispersing the sound energy towards the ceiling. The main PA consists of two lines with the first consisting of two columns 2 Kobra-KK102 on each side supported by two Rumble-KU210 subwoofers. The second line, delayed with respect to the first, is composed of two columns 1 Kobra-KK102 per side. The rear system consists of 2 Kobra-KK102 loudspeakers that adequately cover all the seats facing in the direction of the chapel of the basilica, except for those closest to the main entrance. To ensure full coverage, two flexible Anakonda-KAN200+ speakers were installed and paired with a Rumble-KU210 subwoofer. In addition to the sound reinforcement of the central nave, another K-array system was implemented to provide monitoring for clerics at the high altar comprised of two Vyper-KV52 loudspeakers. Another two Vypers were installed facing the choir and the other seats in the apse. Finally, for the sound reinforcement of the courtyard two Kobra-KK102 loudspeakers were installed in the corners at the entrance leading to the church. The system ensures excellent intelligibility inside the church and is practically invisible, thanks to the use of a limited number of small-sized speakers.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/basilica-santissima-annunziata", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678065"}, "embedding": null}

KAN200 - KAN200+ KAN200+8 Ver. 3.0 4 1. INTRODUCTION 2. KEY FEATURES 3. APPLICATIONS The K-array Anakonda KAN200 is a truly revolutionary speaker module born to meet the needs of places where few had dared to go up to now. It is designed to be a problem solver in situations where a traditional speaker box can’t be used but where good intelligibility, ultra-reliability and a sleek design are required. The KAN200 is the perfect fit for any distributed sound application. Its dedicated presets allow KAN200s to serve as a flexible PA system - either standalone or combined with K-array subwoofers. Its lightness and flexibility help it to be easily integrated in existing structures. Each KAN200 module is 2m (6.6 ft) long. Up to 32 modules can be interconnected to create a continuous sound line, 64m (210 ft) in length. Integrated male and female speakon NL4 connectors hide all connections inside the “body” of the speaker, which creates an elegant, seamless line. The new KAN200+ is even more powerful, featuring double the number of transducers. Up to 16 modules can be interconnected to create a continuous sound line, 32m (105 ft) in length. The KAN200+8 is also available in a low impedance 8-ohm version, allowing for greater power over long distances, which is ideal for installations that do not require a large number of distributed speakers. Each KAN200/KAN200+ includes 2 fabric socks, one black and one white, which can be used to cover and protect the speaker from foreign objects such as dust , and to change the system’s color to suit the application. Wall brackets are included in the package to make the installation as easy and as fast as possible. • Flexible 2mt chassis • Integrated NL4 connectors • High impedance for long lines • IP55 for outdoor installations • Front fill • Outdoor installations • Theme parks • Indoor and outdoor Scenography design 4. PACKAGE CONTENTS 4 x All the components of the Anakonda KAN200/KAN200+ are designed by the K-array R&D department and made in Italy under the K-array quality control system.

{"content": "Domaine de Géline is a renovated 18th century farmhouse in La Falaise. 30 minutes from Paris, with its classic style and modern touches featuring a monumental fireplace makes La Domaine de Géline a fairy-tale location. In 2020 they contacted the Aeitech team to equip the terrace. The property and its magnificent garden can now be rented for various private (weddings, birthdays, baptisms, etc.) or professional events (fictional filming, clips, photo shooting, etc.). The owners wanted an invisible but powerful sound system, with perfectly consistent coverage. Another task was to not disturb their neighbours. K-array's flexible loudspeaker; the Anakonda met all of these requirements. Eight meters of Anakonda were installed on the terrace of Domaine de Géline to guarantee identical sound pressure at all points. Two small Rumble-KU26 boxes were suspended from the trellis of the vine which shelters the terrace and provide reinforcement in the low frequencies, especially during festive uses, while easily blending into the foliage. They remain all the more invisible as their specific RAL matches the nuances of the foliage. That permits them to cover all the pergola outside, and when they have a bigger event, they use Pinnacle-KR202 to provide front fill for the garden. Can you imagine a warmly decorated venue where the sound becomes the extension of the event and not to steal the aesthetics. This compact audio system is totally versatile, as well suited for everyday use, more intimate, as for event and festive occasions. Perfectly resistant to outdoor use, it offers exceptional sound quality in all circumstances. Thanks to Aeitech, this installation is a good illustration of K-array's watchwords, quality, elegance and absolute discretion, to offer the best sound without spoiling the aesthetics of a place.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/domaine-de-geline", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678118"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, has experienced rapid growth since its establishment in 2012, with 2022 revenue exceeding $80 billion. To accommodate this expansion, ByteDance has invested in various commercial properties, including the refurbishment of Zhongkun Plaza in Beijing, which now serves as its headquarters. In addition to providing office and conference facilities, ByteDance has created a 2,000m² showroom in the lobby to showcase their business to visitors and present new products and future plans. However, the showroom faced acoustic challenges due to its hard surfaces and numerous display screens. To address this, a concealed audio system was needed. Beijing Xingqi Bangwei Electronics, a K-array dealer with 30 years of experience in audio and video integration, was chosen as the subcontractor for this innovative project. Challenges and Solutions Miao Zhijun, the technical manager of Xingqi Bangwei, explains that the showroom's design incorporated metal elements for a technological theme, which posed challenges for hiding the audio system. To achieve the best audio quality, an acoustician was brought in to design a solution, incorporating sound absorption materials to reduce sound reflections. Xingqi Bangwei also conducted demonstrations of suitable K-array products for ByteDance. The clients were particularly impressed with K-array's innovative audio solutions and together, they determined the models to be used and their on-site installation. Audio Systems in Different Areas The showroom covers approximately 2,000m² and is divided into three distinct areas. The entrance lobby features a 7.1-channel audio system with Kobra-KK102 1m speakers, Anakonda-KAN200+8 flexible array speakers, Kobra-KK52 0.5m speakers, and Rumble-KU210 passive subwoofers. The cloud server room utilizes Vyper-KV25 ultra-flat line array speakers and Rumble-KU44 compact subwoofers. The main exhibit space showcases ByteDance's diverse business segments and is equipped with Anakonda-KAN200+8 and Vyper-KV25 speakers. Over 20 Vyper-KV25 speakers are installed on the ceiling to provide redundancy if needed. All K-array speakers are powered by Kommander-KA84 and Kommander-KA24 power amplifiers, cleverly concealed within the interior décor. Sound Isolation As the showroom is designed to host multiple visitor groups simultaneously, sound bleed between areas was a critical concern. K-array's Pure Array Technology, which optimizes speaker angles, played a vital role in solving this issue. The narrow vertical coverage angle of the line array speakers allowed them to be placed horizontally, effectively segregating sound and ensuring a seamless experience for each visitor group. Wireless Audio System For commentary and presentations, a ClearOne digital wireless system was implemented, comprising WS-880 digital wireless system receivers with various microphone options. This system ensures clear and reliable audio for two teams of commentators leading visitor groups while allowing for redundancy between systems. The ByteDance showroom at Zhongkun Plaza in Beijing exemplifies the convergence of technology and innovative audio solutions. With K-array's cutting-edge audio systems and careful planning for sound isolation, ByteDance can present its business to visitors in an immersive and acoustically optimized environment. This project showcases how companies are investing in advanced audio solutions to enhance the overall visitor experience", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/byte-bance-tik-tok", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678125"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "With more than 14,500 employees in 37 countries worldwide, QBE is one of the world’s top 20 insurers. Its flagship European headquarters in London features a range of multipurpose meeting spaces, reception, events areas and office spaces. The focal point of the QBE building is the Broker’s Lounge, an impressive 31m x 7.5m space mainly used for presentations, although it can be specifically re-purposed to host live events in a ‘Town Hall’ format, or smaller individual meeting spaces as and when required. To fulfil the need for audio coverage of the flexible space as part of a major upgrade of its AV systems, the audio team was challenged with creating an equally flexible loudspeaker system, including multi-zone coverage. The client’s high expectation in terms of audio quality coupled with a key requirement that the loudspeaker should be invisibly integrated into the room’s décor pointed towards a clear solution. Supplied by UK distributor 2B Heard, and installed by The Pyramid Group, the system is comprised of an evenly-spaced matrix of down-firing Tornado-KT2 speakers, ceiling mounted and positioned between the slats of the contemporary Hunter Douglas suspended ceiling, flush with the lower edges so as to avoid any possible diffraction effects. Working within the physical constraints of the ceiling structure, the Tornados offered the best combination of pleasing aesthetics and desired dispersion. The speakers are configured in groups of seven, with each group aimed towards one row of seating directly below. Each group is assigned to a zone on the AMX touch screen control system, allowing the client to select any combination of zones at a single touch, dependent on the room layout and seating. With aesthetics playing such a major factor in the audio system design and in order to maintain an uncluttered floor space, the very compact dual 10-inch Rumble-KU210 subwoofers are also located above the suspended ceiling, requiring only 15 cm of installation space. One sub is assigned to a group of six Tornados. We worked on a concept that would provide a discreet option. Following initial EASE Focus simulations we then selected a final design, and what we’ve created is an incredibly uniform near field coverage pattern with a natural listening experience even at high levels, and with absolutely no delay effects. For music, the KU210 subs kick in to give serious bass response down to 42Hz. We’ve put as much control over the sound system in the client’s hands as possible. For a music event everything can be full on with subwoofer support, but if they have, for example, a small meeting of only 20 people or so the unused zones can simply be switched off, keeping the audio exceptionally focused. The client is very pleased with the result: the coverage of the room is excellent, spoken word reinforcement is very clear, and the Rumble subs compliment the KT2 Tornados perfectly for a quality music program.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/qbe-hq", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678203"}, "embedding": null}

In addition to a series of contemporary art installations, the Gucci Garden also contains a library, a cafeteria, a small boutique and the Gucci Osteria da Massimo Bottura—a restaurant by a three-Michelin-star chef. With extreme attention given to creating delicate displays throughout the three-story space that honor Gucci craftsmanship, architect studio PLS Design required an inconspicuous audio system that didn’t interrupt the layout but provided enough SPL for pleasant background music to transport visitors through Gucci’s archives, advertising campaigns, artisans’ images and vintage objects. Once they were introduced to K-array and saw the incredibly compact size of the Lyzard-KZ14, they knew they had found the perfect solution. Italian distributor Exhibo, with the help of K-array product specialist Daniele Mochi, were tasked with creating a system for each of the seven different zones on each floor based on the different SPL needs. At the entrance of the museum where ticket office and store are located, a system of six of K-array’s 2” Tornado-KT2 point sources were cleverly mounted to the hanging lighting unit and combined with two Rumble-KU44 subs. Immediately next to it, six practically invisible Lyzard-KZ14 loudspeakers and two Rumble-KU44 subs were seamlessly integrated in the cafeteria. For the restaurant, a discreet system comprised of four Lyzards were paired with two compact Rumble-KU44 subwoofers for even and pleasant background music. Throughout the three-level museum, similar systems are employed alternating between four Lyzard-KZ14 units for surface mount or four Tornado-KT2C point sources to flush the speakers within the ceiling depending on the integration needs of that particular zone.

KK52-KK102 Ver. 3.1 4 1. INTRODUCTION 2. KEY FEATURES 3. APPLICATIONS The K-array Kobras are passive speaker systems, comprised of 2” neodymium magnet transducers housed in an elegant and sturdy stainless steel chassis. Available in two lengths, the KK52 features 8 drivers in a 0.5 m (19.6”), while the KK102 features 16 drivers in a 1 m (39.4”) chassis. The Kobra’s closely spaced cone drivers provide phase coherence, low distortion and focused listening both up close and at a distance. To accommodate a range of applications, the vertical dispersion pattern can be switched for either wide or narrow coverage. Optional rigging and linking accessories allow multiple speakers to be interconnected, creating a wide array of vertical and horizontal configurations for temporary or permanent installation. For integration with other speakers or amplifiers, the KK52 and KK102 offer selectable impedance (16Ω/64Ω for the KK52 and 8Ω/32Ω for the KK102). Kobras are able to reproduce the entire vocal frequency range with excellent intelligibility, starting from 150 Hz. Integrating powered K-array subwoofers (KMT12, KMT18, KMT21) ensures excellent coverage of the entire musical frequency range. K-array’s KA amplifier series also features custom presets, optimized for use with the Kobra series. All Kobra components are designed by K-array and custom-made under K-array’s quality control system. • Unique performance-to-size ratio • Vertical, Horizontal and 3D line-array applications • Multiple 2” long-excursion full-range cone drivers • Wide horizontal coverage • Selectable vertical pattern (Spot/Flood) • Electronically protected • Selectable impedance (KK52: 16/64 Ω, KK102: 8/32 Ω) • Weatherproof, suitable for outdoor installations - IP54 • Theatre, club, house of worship • Front fill and under-balcony fill • Portable and installed AV systems • Stage and AV studio monitoring KK52-KK102 Ver. 3.1 5 4. SAFETY INFORMATION Warning: failure to follow these safety instructions could result in injury or damage to the device or other property. IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS • Read these instructions. • Keep this instructions. • Heed all warnings. • Follow all instructions and keep all warnings. • Only use attachments/accessories specified by the manufacturer. • \u0007Use only with the cart, stand, tripod, bracket, or table specified by the manufacturer or sold with the apparatus. • When a cart is used, use caution when moving the cart/apparatus combination to avoid injury from tip-over. • Avoiding hearing damage. Professional loudspeakers are capable of producing extremely high sound levels and should be used carefully. Never stand close to loudspeakers driven at high volume. Set the volume to a safe level. You can adapt over time to a higher volume of sound that over time may sound normal but can be damaging to your hearing. Hearing loss worsens after exposure to a sound level of 90 dB or over for an extended period of time. If you experience ringing in your ears or muffled speech, stop listening and have your hearing checked. The louder the volume, the less time is required before your hearing could be affected. • \u0007Choking Hazards. This device contains small parts, which may present a choking hazard to small children. Keep the device and its accessories away from small children. • \u0007Do not make repairs yourself. Never attempt to disassemble, repair or modify the system yourself. Disassembling the unit may cause damage that is not covered under the warranty. The device contains no user-serviceable parts. Repairs should only be performed by factory trained service personnel. • \u0007Sound distortion. Do not operate speakers for an extended period of time with sound distortion. This is an indication of malfunction, which in turn can generate heat and result in a fire. • \u0007Carrying, handling and installing the device. The device contains sensitive components. Do not drop, disassemble, open, crush, bend, deform, puncture, shred, incinerate, paint, or insert foreign objects into it. If your device has been dropped or damaged unplug the power cable immediately. • \u0007Set up. Set up your device on a stable retaining horizontal surface. If combined or mechanically connected with other products, always verify the stability of the resulted system. Install the unit only in a location that can structurally support the weight of the unit and far away from people who can interfere with the stability of the system. Assure that the wind does not interfere with the system’s stability, taking extra securities like chains, weights, ropes or any other certified anchoring systems. Doing otherwise may result in the unit falling down, causing personal injury or property damage or even death. The system should only be suspended by qualified personnel following safe rigging practices. Secure fixings to the building structure are vital.

WIRING KK52 and KK102 internal wiring is designed to pick up audio power signal from pins 1+ / 1- of a Speakon NL4 connector. Pins 1+ and 1-, such as pins 2+ and 2-, are directly wired from one socket to the other, so the two sockets are equivalent and can be used to connect the speaker to the amplifier or to connect the speaker to another one driven in parallel by the same amplifier channel. 7.1 IMPEDANCE SWITCH KK52 and KK102 features a switch which allows users to select the impedance of the speaker (KK52: 16/64 Ω, KK102: 8/32 Ω). The value to be selected depends mainly on the amplifier you use to drive the unit. Impedance must be set to high (64 Ω for KK52 and 32 Ω for KK102) when speakers are driven by KMT active modules or by the KA84 amplifier. Low impedance may be used when speakers are driven by a KA24 amplifier. Please refer to your amplifier’s specifications to select the correct speaker impedance for your configuration. IMPEDANCE SWITCH COVERAGE SWITCH KA24 amp KA84 amp KMT sub KK52 @ 16 Ω YES NO NO KK52 @ 64 Ω NO YES YES KK102 @ 8 Ω YES NO NO KK102 @ 32 Ω NO YES YES KK52-KK102 Ver. 3.1 9 KK52 and KK102 features a switch which allows users to select the vertical coverage of the speaker. Flood coverage sets a wide vertical diffusion. Flood coverage is suggested for single speakers in diffused short throw applications to obtain maximum diffusion with a minimum footprint. Spot coverage sets a narrower vertical diffusion angle and is recommended for long throw or monitoring application. When more units are combined in a line array configuration, make sure to set the coverage to Spot. SPOT Coverage FLOOD Coverage 7.2 COVERAGE SWITCH KK52-KK102 Ver. 3.1 10 8. ACCESSORIES AND CONFIGURATIONS K-array offers a variety of dedicated accessories to mount and interconnect the speakers for a wide range of applications.

{"content": "The Mesnerhaus is an historic building, located in the small town of Rauris, well known for its famous literature days, the “Rauriser Literaturtage”. First mentioned in an historic document in 1330, over centuries has been employed as private residence, school, warehouse and recently as a cinema. The Archdiocese of Salzburg took ownership of the house in 1550, from then on it served as a sacristan's house, vicariate house and residence for teachers and organists. In the 1950s, the Old Mesnerhaus was redesigned into a cinema and operated as such until 1970. Now completely renovated, in January 2020 the historic buidling was blessed and given its new purpose as a house for culture and literature. The building has two floors where events (professional and cultural) can be held. It offers a state-of-the-art event hall on the upper floor with variable seating for up to 170 people, as well as additional rooms for smaller occasions on the ground floor. These historical vaults from the 14th century are also comfortably heated. The main room’s sound installation was made with K-array’s speakers, supported by Elektro Gerstgraser. The audio concept is by Alfred Nindl supported by Music Lenz, K-array's Austrian’s distributor. Because of the high reverberations from the main hall, this wasn’t an easy job: ten Kobra-KK52 and three Rumble-KU212 were installed in the structure of the wooden beams built underneath the original roof. Capture-KMC20 microphones have been used to amplify the orator's voice. Capture is ideal for this application, because of its innovative form, tiny and elegant, capable of high performances in some of the most demanding environments.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/mesnerhaus-hall", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678394"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "The Svetitskhoveli Cathedral (literally the Cathedral of the Living Pillar, known as the burial site of the claimed Christ's mantle) needed a new sound system. At that time the existing sound reinforcement system of the temple was partially functional and obsolete, far away from modern requirements for the quality of sound reinforcement. Svetitskhoveli is an Orthodox Christian cathedral located in the historic town of Mtskheta, Georgia. A masterpiece of the Early and High Middle Ages, it’s recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The church administration addressed the Show Technic Center to brief them on the large task ahead. First of all by providing coverage of the sound field of the entire indoor environment with an uneven audio no more than +/- 3 dB, then an average sound pressure level in the sound field with reflections (total) SPL max = 95 dB. Other requirements were good speech intelligibility and ensuring stable operations of microphones without the occurrence of acoustic feedback in proximity of sound systems. Due to the fact that Svetitskhoveli Cathedral is a historical monument of the World Heritage (XI century), included in the UNESCO list, the task was complicated to say the least. The sound system shouldn’t interfere with the building structure for the purpose of laying cables and it should have minimal visibility and discreet to avoid introducing dissonance into its original design. Show Technic Center proposed an installation divided in sections: for the altar space two Pythons-KP52, the two inner churches two Vyper-KV25 and two Vyper-KV52. The central space is composed of four Kobra-KK52, two Vyper-KV25 and two Vyper-KV52 that adequately cover all the nave. This installation beyond expectations met all the requirements of the customer and is an exemplary sound reinforcement system for Orthodox churches in the region of Georgia.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/svetitskhoveli-cathedral-georgia", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678401"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "The new Splash Pool at Butlin’s Bognor Regis has been designed to provide family entertainment for everyone and to complement the Wave Pool’s extremes of calm and exhilarating moments, the developers wanted a sound system capable of matching dynamic range and clear intelligibility – but insisted that it should not be seen. Ruling out traditionally shaped loudspeaker enclosures left a clear choice for Milton Keynes-based audio, lighting and video specialist Technical Arts Ltd, and led them to propose professional quality K-array speakers with an aesthetic that would allow the speakers to blend invisibly into the environment. As part of a £40m investment that has introduced a new 6,300 sq. meter pool capable of accommodating up to 950 guests at any one time, several areas were identified that needed updated audio systems to cater for simple background music over multiple zones, but the real challenge came with the design of the main pool area sound system, and specifically the Wave Pool where ambient sound levels can be very high amidst a generally reverberant environment. The clients wanted a system capable of high intelligibility to play custom music stings when the wave pool event is triggered, drawing people into the wave pool and also giving others a chance to move to quieter areas to please all the people all the time. In addition, the audio system had to be capable of running their pool parties and the adult weekenders that feature DJs, and so it needed to be of high quality throughout the operational range. Crucially, they didn’t want to see the sound system to not detract in any way from the Splash Pool’s boldly colorful design. On each of the four lamp posts that flank the wave pool, a pair of Kobra-KK102 white line arrays were installed to form a two-meter vertical column. The inner two columns were horizontally rotated inwards to focus on the pool, with additional rear firing Kobra-KK52 line arrays covering the small stepped areas on either side of the wave pool. The outer two columns were rotated slightly outwards to improve coverage across the wide beach area. The line arrays are supplemented by four Thunder-KMT18P subwoofers located in the front wall above the wave machine giving three sources to align into one wavefront, and providing solid low end and a full frequency response. The complete speaker system is powered by two Kommander-KA84 4-channel amplifiers housed in a central equipment rack. I’m delighted with what’s been achieved. It was a difficult process, and a difficult environment because of the sheer size and scale of the project. We worked closely with the electrical contractor and Kier Construction so it was truly a collaborative effort that has resulted in on-time, on-budget project delivery despite the technical and logistical challenges.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/butlins", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678408"}, "embedding": null}

SAFETY INFORMATION Warning: failure to follow these safety instructions could result in injury or damage to the device or other property. IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS • Read these instructions. • Keep this instructions. • Heed all warnings. • Follow all instructions and keep all warnings. • Only use attachments/accessories specified by the manufacturer. • \u0007Use only with the cart, stand, tripod, bracket, or table specified by the manufacturer or sold with the apparatus. • When a cart is used, use caution when moving the cart/apparatus combination to avoid injury from tip-over. • Avoiding hearing damage. Professional loudspeakers are capable of producing extremely high sound levels and should be used carefully. Never stand close to loudspeakers driven at high volume. Set the volume to a safe level. You can adapt over time to a higher volume of sound that over time may sound normal but can be damaging to your hearing. Hearing loss worsens after exposure to a sound level of 90 dB or over for an extended period of time. If you experience ringing in your ears or muffled speech, stop listening and have your hearing checked. The louder the volume, the less time is required before your hearing could be affected. • \u0007Choking Hazards. This device contains small parts, which may present a choking hazard to small children. Keep the device and its accessories away from small children. • \u0007Do not make repairs yourself. Never attempt to disassemble, repair or modify the system yourself. Disassembling the unit may cause damage that is not covered under the warranty. The device contains no user-serviceable parts. Repairs should only be performed by factory trained service personnel. • \u0007Sound distortion. Do not operate speakers for an extended period of time with sound distortion. This is an indication of malfunction, which in turn can generate heat and result in a fire. • \u0007Carrying, handling and installing the device. The device contains sensitive components. Do not drop, disassemble, open, crush, bend, deform, puncture, shred, incinerate, paint, or insert foreign objects into it. If your device has been dropped or damaged unplug the power cable immediately. • \u0007Set up. Set up your device on a stable retaining horizontal surface. If combined or mechanically connected with other products, always verify the stability of the resulted system. Install the unit only in a location that can structurally support the weight of the unit and far away from people who can interfere with the stability of the system.

WIRING KK52 I and KK102 I internal wiring is designed to pick up audio power signal from pins 1+ / 1- of a Speakon NL4 connector. Pins 1+ and 1-, such as pins 2+ and 2-, are directly wired from one socket to the other, so the two sockets are equivalent and can be used to connect the speaker to the amplifier or to connect the speaker to another one driven in parallel by the same amplifier channel. 7.1 IMPEDANCE SWITCH KK52 I and KK102 I features a switch which allows users to select the impedance of the speaker (KK52: 16/64 Ω, KK102: 8/32 Ω). The value to be selected depends mainly on the amplifier you use to drive the unit. Impedance must be set to high (64 Ω for KK52 and 32 Ω for KK102) when speakers are driven by KMT active modules or by the KA84 amplifier. Low impedance may be used when speakers are driven by a KA24 amplifier. Please refer to your amplifier’s specifications to select the correct speaker impedance for your configuration.

Flood coverage sets a wide vertical diffusion. Flood coverage is suggested for single speakers in diffused short throw applications to obtain maximum diffusion with a minimum footprint. Spot coverage sets a narrower vertical diffusion angle and is recommended for long throw or monitoring application. When more units are combined in a line array configuration, make sure to set the coverage to Spot. SPOT Coverage FLOOD Coverage 7.2 COVERAGE SWITCH KK52 I - KK102 I Ver. 4 10 8. ACCESSORIES AND CONFIGURATIONS K-array offers a variety of dedicated accessories to mount and interconnect the speakers for a wide range of applications. In this section we introduce you to the main accessories available for this product. 8.1 SUSPENDING FROM THE FLY-BAR KK52 I and KK102 I units can be suspended using the K-FLY3 fly bar accessory and the K-JOINT3 hardware accessory used to connect together two units or to connect a unit to the fly bar. Mixed configuration with both KK52 Is and KK102 I in the same cluster are also possible.

{"content": "When the Colosseum hosted a live screening of the film, The Gladiator, it was the embodiment of the perfect pairing a performance in the most relevant venue. For one night only, Ridley Scott’s historical epic was screened in HD and accompanied by a live performance of the Hans Zimmer-composed soundtrack, courtesy of conductor Justin Freer and the musicians and choir of the Italian Film Orchestra. Australian vocalist, Lisa Gerrard, who sang on the movie’s soundtrack and served as its co-composer, also added her otherworldly talents to the event; all of which unfolded within the storied ruins of antiquity’s most infamous entertainment venue, the Colosseum. This prestigious event was staged by film score performance specialist CineConcerts, in support of Rotary’s End Polio Now campaign, and attended by stars of the film such as Maximus himself, Russell Crowe, and ‘the eighth king of Rome’; former AS Roma striker Francesco Totti. Such a luminous occasion required a truly world class audio setup; with the gauntlet ultimately being thrown down before technical supplier Planet Service - and the K-array Firenze system. As well as the charity curtain raiser for an exclusive crowd of 300 at the Colosseum on 6 June, a pair of larger events were held on the Friday and Saturday of the same week, around the corner at former chariot racing stadium (and modern-day concert venue), Circo Massimo. These shows required a scaled-up production across the board, which also meant bringing in kit and crew from K-array itself. The PA system at the Colosseum comprised of 3 Firenze-KH7 line array elements per side as main hangs, 4 Mugello-KS5 subwoofers, 16 Kobra-KK102 loudspeakers as front fill, and 3 sets of Python-KP102 loudspeakers lined down the entrance as left and right delays. There was also a pair of KH7s flown in the middle of the truss, used specifically to project the film’s dialogue. Audio Crew Chief for rental company Planet Service, Alessandro Saudelli, explained: “The major challenge was to have perfect PA coverage without being able to put the cluster in the correct position. The screen was on the back of the stage so we needed to stay as wide as possible with the main left and right hangs, in order to allow the best sight lines. The problem was that the speakers were so wide that they didn’t cover the central corridor adequately, so we added 3 rows of Pythons as delays to cover it with the same precision and quality of the rest of the venue.” - As well as having very little space, the crew also had to deal with the relatively slender load limits that were afforded by the venue’s floor. This surface, which was originally installed to allow visitors to stand atop the labyrinthine bowels of Colosseum, can only support a maximum of 200kg/sqm. Planet Service’s Emanuele Vischi explained: “We cannot fly a large PA because of these load limits, but the Firenze is very small and perfect for the job. This also helps with manvorability during the load in and setup, which helps when you are essentially working inside a museum!” - The more substantial audio setup required at Circo Massimo meant that K-array was asked to provide supplementary kit, including 24 of its flagship Firenze-KH8 speakers. The full rig at used on the more conventional festival-style stage at Circus Maximus consisted of 12 units of KH8 line array elements per side, 16 Firenze-KS8 subwoofers for low end reinforcement, 6 KH7s split as central left and right hangs, 8 Mugello-KH2 loudspeakers as front fill, and 3 more KH7s per side as delays.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/gladiator-concert-colosseum-circo-massimo", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678525"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "•20240126• Description Half meter stainless steel line array element with 3.15” drivers Python-KP52 I Introducing the Python-KP52 I: a passive line array element comprised of 6x 3.15” neodymium magnet transducers housed in an elegant and sturdy stainless steel half-meter frame. The six closely spaced cone drivers provide true line array characteristics thanks to Pure Array Technology (PAT). The KP52 can reproduce the entire vocal frequency range with high intelligibility with a frequency response from 120 Hz to 18kHz and integrating one of our Thunder-KS or Rumble-KU subwoofers assures excellent coverage of the entire musical frequency range. The innovation of the KP52 I lies in its ability to be set for full-range reproduction, providing a frequency response starting from 70 Hz. This feature is ideal for applications where the use of subwoofers is not desired, allowing for excellent low-frequency reproduction and precision, combined with the increased directivity characteristic of a line array. The KP52 I provides selection to change the vertical dispersion pattern for wide (Flood) or narrow (Spot) coverage, allowing for a great variety of applications. It also features selectable 8Ω or 32Ω impedance that provides easier use and integration with other speakers or amplifiers. At 32Ω as many as 8 KP52 I speakers can be powered off a single amplifier channel at 4Ω, which eliminates the need of 70V lines for wider-distributed installed systems. A variety of rigging accessories provides many linking and hanging options for vertical and horizontal line array configurations that satisfy many different venue requirements during temporary events and permanent installations. • 6x3.15” Neodymium magnet woofers • Pure Array Technology • 128 dBpeak max SPL (Natural Preset) • Full-Range preset available - 70Hz - 18kHz • Selectable vertical dispersion pattern (Spot - Flood) • 8Ω – 32Ω selectable load impedance • Modular capabilities • Visually discreet • IP65 suitable for indoors and outdoors installations with dedicated IP accessory • Stainless Steel • Available in black, white and custom RAL color All Python-KP52 I components are designed by the K-array R&D department and are custom made under the K-array quality control system.

To reproduce low frequencies and extend the overall frequency response of the system, it is necessary to pair them with dedicated subwoofers from the Thunder-KS family. This approach allows for the creation of a scalable and adaptable audio system suitable for various applications in the audio industry, ranging from installations to live events. It’s important to consider this when approaching the installation of the speaker and the overall system. Loudspeakers Presets Natural Full-Range Each Python-KP can be used with natural preset, with a dedicated frequency response and crossover frequency when paired with a subwoofer, or in full-range mode. The Full- range preset is designed to extend the speaker’s frequency response in the mid-to-low range and is particularly suitable for applications where the use of a subwoofer may be limited due to space constraints, different requirements, or to contribute to low-frequency extension with precision and efficiency.

{"content": "Vanbarton Group is a privately owned, vertically integrated real estate investment and advisory firm with corporate offices located in New York City and San Francisco. The New York City headquarters features an outdoor balcony that wraps around the side of the building facing Madison Avenue, one of the main streets of the Big Apple. Vanbarton Group needed a suitable sound system that could weather the elements while providing crystal clear audio without compromise. In a thriving city, a relaxing outdoor space to meet with clients is truly a luxury. The balcony required full coverage for a narrow, but long outdoor space. The speakers had to be low profile and have immaculate clarity and sound to compete with the bustling city environment below. Global Audio Systems came up with a solution consisting of seventeen Python-KP52 speakers installed at the top of the balcony accompanied by six Rumble-KU212 subwoofers. Visually discreet and weather-resistant, K-array sound systems provided the versatility required for this kind of installation. Owners and clients visiting the balcony love the clarity of the sound and are amazed by the amount of output that was capable.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/vanbarton-balcony", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678637"}, "embedding": null}

This approach allows for the creation of a scalable and adaptable audio system suitable for various applications in the audio industry, ranging from installations to live events. It’s important to consider this when approaching the installation of the speaker and the overall system. Loudspeakers Presets Natural Full-Range Each Python-KP can be used with natural preset, with a dedicated frequency response and crossover frequency when paired with a subwoofer, or in full-range mode. The Full- range preset is designed to extend the speaker’s frequency response in the mid-to-low range and is particularly suitable for applications where the use of a subwoofer may be limited due to space constraints, different requirements, or to contribute to low-frequency extension with precision and efficiency.

Before driving the loudspeakers ensure to load the proper loudspeaker factory preset on Kommander-KA amplifier. Amplifier Channel Matching The number of Python-KP I that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on the K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Mounting and rigging accessories K-WALL2 / K-WALL2L Any Python-KP I can be mounted on-wall and tilted with two dedicated mounting brackets that can be purchased separately, K-WALL2 and K-WALL2L. K-JOINT3 / K-FLY3 K-JOINT3 and K-FLY3 are two useful rigging hardware to hang more speakers in array configurations with the ease of very few steps. Correct and safe rigging procedures for K-array systems are ensured only with dedicated K-array rigging hardware accessories. Detailed information an mounting procedures for Python-KP on wall and in array can be found here: Accessories Assembly For Column Speakers on K-array website. Before connecting the loudspeaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP. K-array cannot be held responsible for any damage resulting from the use of third-party rigging materials.

{"content": "For his brand's new restaurant, renowned 2 Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge wanted the right ambience for the Corinthia Hotel in London. This grand opening provided an opportunity to upgrade and modernize the sound systems, which at the time consisted of mainly ceiling speakers that struggled to project effectively from the seven-metres high position they were installed before. The chef and his team turned to audio-visual integration specialist AT&C Professional Systems together with 2B Heard, our British distributor, for a high-performance solution. The ceiling height was a major challenge. It can get quite echoey in a room of that design. The solution was much more of a near-field approach, using both K-array’s sub-compact line arrays and small point source speakers, and that has made everything much more controlled and intelligible. Python-KP102 line arrays in black are fitted to the dark timber panelling at the left and right of the back wall of the bar creating an upbeat ambience, covering all of the bar area and providing mid and high frequencies down most of the restaurant area. These are supplemented with a pair of Thunder-KMT18 18-inch subwoofers which provide the capability for that part of the system to go up a few notches in level when required. The lower SPL restaurant area is covered by four Domino-KF26 full range point source speakers located on the window bar returns, filling in the frequencies that begin to tail off with distance from the bar area. Two Rumble-KU26 dual six-inch low frequency speakers are fitted within the restaurant fixed seating. With the majority of the low frequencies coming from the bar area subs, no additional subwoofers were needed in the restaurant. The entire system runs from a single Kommander-KA24 4-channel amplifier situated along with the control equipment in a wall-mounted rack in the cloakroom. At Kerridge's Bar & Grill you can expect an outstanding culinary experience from Tom Kerridge and his team and an auditory experience to match, thanks to a K-array speaker system that delivers dynamic sounds and looks the part in equal measure. I’m really pleased with the way the K-array systems have improved the overall quality. It sounds awesome, and it can go pretty loud for those party occasions that demand a bit more energy and SPL. I can’t think of another speaker brand that would be capable of fulfilling the brief both acoustically and visually.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/kerridge-bar-grill", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678730"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "The biggest TV station in China, CCTV accommodates employees and customers at their new multimedia center with a K-array system for live broadcasts. With the development of the Internet and 5G, nowadays more and more traditional TV stations have started to build their own multimedia center to cover more users through mobile phone use. As the biggest TV station in China with a network of 50 channels and access to more than one billion viewers, China Central Television (CCTV, formerly Beijing Television) was the first to implement 5G and used this new technology to send their news and TV programs to viewers. With such a large number of employees located at their new multicenter along with a high traffic volume of customers to accommodate, the customer required an invisible audio system and good sound coverage to reinforce the live TV broadcasts in house. Beijing Viaudio, the K-array distributor in Beijing, invited CCTV to their showroom for a demo and the client was very satisfied with the small size and unbelievable SPL of the Italian manufacturer’s products. Also, their speaker design was highly appreciated. 3 Azimut-KAMUT2V25 complete audio systems with 2 Vyper-KV25 flat line arrays paired with a Truffle-KTR26 sub and a Kommander-KA02 amp each, were selected along with 2 Python-KP102 line arrays and 1 Rumble-KU212 driven by a Kommander-KA24 to amplify the audio in the center. And thanks to the onboard DSP feature on the amplifier, CCTV saved costs on the processors as the KA02 is an all-in-one solution, requiring less equipment. The setup was typical 2.1 system installation and the Kommander-KA02 from the Azimut system and Kommander-KA24 utilized their own DSP for tuning. The sound is very good and nobody is aware the speakers exist. Thanks to the narrow sound beam of the Python, we installed them high on the back of the stage wall facing the audience area to avoid microphone feedback onstage.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/cctv-china", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678737"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Originally conceived as a social space for Brixton, Upstairs at The Department Store was initially opened to friends, family and the local community, and as popularity rapidly grew, Upstairs Brixton launched as a laidback rooftop members’ club in November 2018 with a new and aesthetically pleasing sound system from K-array. Offering a huge selection of sensory entertainment in addition to a full dining experience served on the stunning rooftop dining terrace, Upstairs Brixton regularly hosts member events such as live performances and DJ weekends, comedy, gin and whiskey tasting, launch parties and orchestral recitals – all requiring high quality sound reinforcement in varying degrees. When the previous audio system was deemed to be unserviceable, with no potential left for expansion, the owners turned to integrated specialists Flux London for a solution that would totally modernise the venue, and give them a flexible configuration that would allow several different sources to be routed into combinations of zones throughout the venue depending on the event taking place. Recognizing that a high-quality line array speaker system would be required from an acoustic perspective, K-array presented an obvious choice in terms of sympathetic aesthetics, and so the Italian brand’s UK distributor 2B Heard was brought in to further develop the solution. Although the bar and restaurant occupy essentially the same space, the objective was to treat them as quite separate audio areas, each with their own independent sound level so that the restaurant would generally be quieter than the bar. As befitting a multi-use venue, audio levels change throughout the day, taking in lunch service, after-work drinks, and into the evening’s eating and drinking, and when club DJs are invited to play in the bar SPLs increase significantly at weekends and into the early hours of the morning – and that required a system capable of transitioning from background sound to full-on banging beats, and all managed from a simple app-based control system. Close attention was paid to the speaker locations, with a lot of time and consultation focused on perfecting the visually sympathetic and acoustically correct positioning. In order to identify the optimum speaker positions and accurately predict coverage, 2B Heard Director Dave Wooster provided an EASE design which allowed Chaffey and the installations team to place speakers in key areas to even out the sound field, and provide more audio separation between the bar and restaurant zones. In the main bar four Python-KP102 I column arrays replaced the original speakers, the one-meter columns with their 12 closely-spaced drivers providing focused long throw coverage of the bar area. These are supplemented by a Thunder-KMT18P high power passive 18-inch sub and a Rumble-KU212 slim profile dual 12-inch line array sub, adding up to give plenty of low-end punch when needed. Meanwhile, providing coverage of the restaurant and lounging area, six Python-KP52 variable beam line arrays together with two Rumble-KU212 dual 12-inch subs deliver an altogether more muted ambience, but are still able to effortlessly crank up the volume to party levels. The result was seamless coverage of the three separate areas allowing for the changes in SPL that the venue required throughout the day – from the quietest part of the day and with plenty of headroom to spare, up to a level that is never likely to be exceeded. Unusual for an entertainment venue, all the K-array columns are constructed from stainless steel housings, which not only gives them a modernistic, high tech look, they are also sure to endure. In the newly equipped rack are a Kommander-KA84 4 x 2000 watt DSP amplifier and two KA24 4 x 300 watt DSP amplifiers powering the entire speaker system. Client George Squire, Facilities Manager at Upstairs Brixton, concluded about the installation: “Sound in any hospitality environment provides atmosphere – it’s just essential. We knew the K-array speakers were slimline but I think they look great – they are so discreet that sound appears to come from nowhere.” K-array’s slim line arrays have succeeded in bringing out the best of the intelligible speech typical of a commercial column but with the musicality of larger mainstream line arrays, and with an aesthetic that really works in such a design-led venue as Upstairs Brixton, which has a close association with the neighbouring architects firm that designed it. We also had to re-use some of the previous speaker locations, which constrained us slightly – some of the speakers are mounted on structural pillars made of Green Oak which required specific permission from the main architectural partners – but since K-array’s discreet profiles and multiple bracketing options allowed us to optimise our fixing methods these challenges were easily overcome.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/upstairs-brixton", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678744"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "The Benjamin Brown Graham Memorial Chapel at Washington University in St. Louis, MO has undergone an extensive audio transformation, marking a significant milestone in its rich history. Spearheaded by project manager Jeff Allen and executed over a meticulous 18-month period, the project prioritized achieving two key goals: seamlessly integrating an audio system to enhance the overall clarity of the chapel while honoring its architectural integrity. Graham Chapel as it’s known on campus features soaring 45-foot ceilings and stone interior walls that posed a unique acoustic challenge. The project began with 12 months of thorough audio analysis to guarantee a perfect match for the chapel’s multiple services and events throughout the year. Ultimately, K-array’s elegant architectural speaker designs and accurate sound reproduction won over key stakeholders, setting the stage for a brand new audio experience for the 785 person capacity venue. The decision was solidified after an on-site demonstration, where K-array’s solutions showcased their ability to provide full coverage sound with exceptional clarity from the front to the back of the chapel as well as the balcony. The slim, discreet speakers from K-array disappeared into the woodwork without visually disrupting the space. Rigorous testing and adjustments during the installation phase ensured optimal performance throughout the chapel, eliminating previous issues with inconsistent volume levels and reverberation. System designer Jeff Allen emphasized the significant improvement in sound clarity, especially at lower volumes eliminating the need to “push the amps too hard” and avoiding distortion at higher volumes. Leveraging K-array’s K-framework 3, a powerful 3D modeling software, multiple system configurations were tested during the acoustic design phase. The software, alongside additional EASE acoustic modeling data provided by David Bick of McClure Engineering, ensured optimal system performance. At its core, the system consists of ten flown Kayman-KY52 speakers in a true stereo L/R configuration. For clear coverage in the front, two Python-KP52 I speakers were added for front fill. Rounding out the setup are two compact passive Thunder-KS2P I 18” subwoofers powered by dual 8 channel Kommander-KA208 amplifiers. TSI Global in St. Louis secured the project and brought in engineers Lee Buckalew and Garrison Brown who took charge of rigging, installation, and final commissioning. The project culminated on January 12, just in time for the 37th Annual Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration held at full capacity. The event served as a perfect showcase for the new system’s clarity and intelligibility, receiving high praise from attendees. “The K-array system’s unique design and advanced features proved to be the perfect fit for the Graham Chapel. The powerful modeling software allowed us to optimize the system for the space, and the final results speak for themselves. Clear, even sound at all volumes creating a truly immersive experience for the audience.” – Jeff Allen, System Designer and Media Technology Manager, Washington University The recent K-array sound system installation at Graham Memorial Chapel is a notable achievement. This new audio technology allows the historic chapel to offer visitors an improved listening experience while respecting and preserving the building’s architectural elements. By implementing innovative sound solutions, the chapel can provide a richer and more immersive audio environment without compromising its historic integrity.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/graham-chapel", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678814"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "The Camellias, a luxury residential project in New Delhi which offers smartly designed homes. Premium residences are surrounded with lush greenery and a healthy environment. These super luxury residences offer unparalleled amenities, gorgeous views and truly personalized service including a private high luxury home cinema. Camellias was heavily featured at the CEDIA Awards EMEA 2021, bringing a total of four Awards (Home Cinema Level III EMEA, Best Dressed Rack EMEA, Best Documentation EMEA and Home Cinema Global) home after winning the CEPro Home of the Year Award earlier. THE CHALLENGE The client wished for the cinema room to also be used as a theater for live performances. All features of the cinema setup were to be controllable from a single device with the touch of a single button and the room was to be AV calibrated. For the audio cinema design, the performance objective was to maintain 105db at the listening position. This set-up is capable of playing all 3 audio formats including Dolby Atmos, Auro 3D and DTS:X. The set-up includes an immersive Trinnov layout of 21.6.10. The home cinema set-up would be used for movies, talk shows and live performances by musical bands. The sound systems and acoustics had to be customized to handle the openness of the space and provide a vibrant sound across all seats of the auditorium. THE SOLUTION Macbee, the system integrator, together with K-array's distributor ISD India were in charge of this entire project from start to finish; the goal was to create a unique, discrete, world-class private cinema with the largest screen possible and seating capacity for 45-50 people. If that wasn’t enough, the client also wanted the space to double up as an auditorium for five performances. All the cinema features had to be controlled from a single device at the touch of a button and the room needed to be AV calibrated. This cinema set-up includes an immersive Trinnov layout of 21.6.10. The following aspects of speaker placements have been taken into account while designing this project: Recommendations for multiple listening positions: Adapting the number of surround speakers to the size of the listening area Adapting the type of surround speakers to the shape of the listening area All rear/back speakers should be behind the listening area. All rear left speakers should be heard at the left of the listening area. Cross-firing is recommended to achieve best overall position and immersion for all seats at the expense of a slight compromise at the MLP. For the placement of the front wide speakers for a normal L/R angle of ±36°, they considered the median angle method as well as the bisector angle method, involving few surround speakers or many surround speakers. When the listening area is long, the angle between the top speakers (front top, top, middle top and rear top) can become significantly larger than the angle between the other speakers. In this case, it is recommended to array the top and/or the middle top speakers to achieve more uniform loudspeaker coverage. This array should be achieved with constant power signal distribution. For the subwoofer placement they have made a room analysis and placed the seats in the optimized zone with moderated peaking and no nulling. Modal peaks are areas where mode frequencies are blasting loud, causing distortions such as boomy bass. Modal nulls are areas where the mode frequency is canceled and becomes very quiet. All subwoofers were positioned in the corners of the room. The front of the room, we used two subwoofers on each side to get more gain from the subs. Total subwoofers used in this layout are six including four in the front of the room and two in the rear. They examined various aspects under these considerations including: room size and specifications, variables that add heat to the room, people (with a desired occupancy of 45-50), home cinema equipment and placement and acceptable noise level from projector fans for clear audio output in all parts of the room. On this project, they used the following K-array products: twenty Kayman-KY102 line array speakers, twenty-six Domino-KF212, six Thunder-KSC18P and stage monitor during live performances two Turtle-KRM33P. “The project set-up is truly discrete and well interwoven into the structural design. It is immersive and encompassing that you feel absorbed in the sound experience from all sides of the room. When combined with the visuals of the cinema set-up as well as the ambient lighting during a live show, it’s easy to forget where you are. Overall a fantastic project design visually, aesthetically and acoustically.”", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/camellias-luxury-cinema", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678907"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Two important events took place on September 5, 6 and 7 at the iconic Arena di Verona: Seat Music Awards 2020 and HEROES - Il futuro inizia adesso. These are two live concerts attended by some of the best Italian artists who came together to support fundraising for all entertainment operators through the social enterprise Music Innovation Hub. During the show tributes were given to the social and health workers involved in this unusual period. Medical staff were invited to participate for free in the evening on the steps of the Arena. The reduced capacity of about 4000 people and complexity to comply with the spacing rules meant that the stage design had to be well thought out, eventually they opted for the centre of the Arena. For this event, the task of equipping the show with unforgettable sound was entrusted to Agorà S.r.L. of L'Aquila who aimed for excellent coverage in a 360 °configuration. The primary requirement was a minimalist visual encumbrance in order to show the beauty of the arena and the complete performance of the artists who would be broadcasting live for all to see. The project was carried out by Daniele Tramontani, Sound Designer. His solution was to fly eight clusters around four corners of the stage, each consisting of six Firenze-KH7 for a total of forty-eight KH7. To complete the Fly system, forty-six subwoofers were installed, distributed on the ground to form a virtual ring around the stage and a further sixteen Kayman-KY102 to cover the audience close to the stage. The KH7 could deliver clean, uniform sound that provides even coverage all around the arena so that everyone can enjoy the top sound quality thanks to the Slim Array Technology that allows an hyper cardioid dispersion pattern on the horizontal plane; thus it allowed to minimize the amount of energy sent to the center of the stage and the noise pollution for the artists. As a final attention to the FOH engineers involved in this particular context, a reference listening unit was installed in the FOH control rooms composed of Pythons-KP52 and Thunder-KMT18 for monitoring the console. The same 360 ° solution was expertly developed by Agorà and his team in Claudio Baglioni's \"Al Centro\" tour: a long experience through the main Italian Palasports that allowed to evolve solutions that were immediately exported to the Arena. The performances of the artists confirmed that the combination of the KH7 system and Agorà's professionalism has become an excellent result. The Firenze-KH7 system was able to reproduce a high intelligibility together with a well calibrated and homogeneous sound. The system and the solutions adopted proved to be optimal for this special installation at the Verona Arena where K-array is already a familiar invisible addition to the acoustics of this historic venue.

{"content": "Bleau Bar is the “hallowed” place to be in Miami for entertainment. Famous in the '50s and ’60s, it has long been regarded as the meeting place for many celebrities. Mixology is at the heart of its success, serving everything from classic to avant-garde cocktails. The venue demands high performance audio where the balance between party mode and conversations can flow elegantly throughout. The recent renovation of the Bleau Bar within the iconic Fontainebleau Miami Beach Luxury Hotel generally provided a myriad of challenges for K-array’s integration partner Global Audio Systems; they required high SPL with focused coverage in the Bar's area moreover, the location is protected by the local Historic Preservation Board which has a very intricate compliance process. The circular space with 20’ ceilings is covered in tall glass windows and has a polished marble terrace which has historically created a cacophony of sound reverberation. Because of its party attitude and spacious dance floor, it needed an appropriate installation for the live sound and Dj sets. Twelve Kayman-KY102 were installed to manage a well-balanced high SPL. Global Audio Systems worked hand in hand with legendary designer John Rawlins in incorporating the slim look of the KY102 with the architectural design created by Mr. Rawlins. You don’t notice they are even there, but the stereo soundstage is wide and airy. The system was designed with Ease Focus by Nathan Short of Global Audio Systems. This step allowed them to predict the spillover in the main lobby area and guest areas. With proper placement of speakers and subwoofers, Global Audio Systems was able to achieve an 18db drop in SPL in those areas, a better balance with no compromise. Bleau Bar was a real challenge. Primarily because this venue is protected by the local historic preservation board which has a very strict compliance process. Jason Ojeda of Global Audio Systems devised a focused system that not only met the strict aesthetics as dictated by the Historic Preservation Board but more importantly, provided a system that sounds brilliant. As thrilled as we are with the architectural design of the space and its many luxurious details, the exceptional sound is what hotel management and our patrons have been praising.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/bleau-bar-miami", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.678925"}, "embedding": null}

To ensure proper operation, please carefully read the owner’s manuals and safety instruction before using the products. After reading this manual, be sure to keep it for future reference. Should you have any questions about your new device please contact K-array customer service at support@k-array.com or contact the official K-array distributor in your country. The Kayman-KY102-EBS steerable line array loudspeaker has been designed to provide an advanced solution to control emission and directivity of the sound source. The Electronic Beam Steering integration with PAT – Pure Array Technology –, combines accuracy and even coverage with maximum control over directivity of the Kayman-KY102-EBS line array where each of the eight woofers can be independently processed trough FIR filters. The dynamic control and manipulation of the sound beam by means of K-array Kommander-KA power amplifier with EBS DSP allows to precisely aim the emission of the line array loudspeaker over the desired listening area. This is particularly essential in environments where the risk of sound leaks or dispersion is high, such as reflective halls where traditional speaker tilting is restricted. 4 Kayman-KY102-EBS USER GUIDE Unpacking Each K-array loudspeaker is built to the highest standard and thoroughly inspected before leaving the factory. Upon arrival, carefully inspect the shipping carton, then examine and test your new amplifier. If you find any damage, immediately notify the shipping company. Check that the following parts are supplied with the product. A. 1x Kayman-KY102-EBS with built-in 5 m (16.4 ft) signal cable. Electronic Beam Steering Traditional line array loudspeakers are appreciated for their narrow on-axis directivity: the Kayman-KY102-EBS can break this paradigm with non need of any specific mechanical arrangement. The Kayman-KY102-EBS features eight 4” drivers that can be directly and independently driven by eight separated amplifier channels. The Kommander-KA18 is the dedicated K-array 8-channel audio power amplifier with DSP designed to perfectly match with the Kayman-KY102-EBS’ eight 4” drivers. By freely updating the Kommander-KA18 DSP firmware to the EBS version, it is possible to modify the natural emission of the line array loudspeaker by steering the sound beam off-axis. This feature can be used to overcome some limitations of the physical installation of the loudspeaker allowing to modify the directivity of the loudspeaker according to the actual listening configuration. The K-framework3 is the all-in-one software providing both the acoustical simulations of the loudspeakers coverage and fine tuning of a sound reinforcement system. Thanks to the K-framework3, designing, configuring and tuning a sound reinforcement system composed of Kommander-KA18 amplifiers with EBS DSP and Kayman-KY102-EBS steerable loudspeakers can be easily accomplished in few simple steps.

To have a coherent image and sound coverage, as point source full-range speakers they can be placed as follow: • Position the speakers at a height where the tweeters align with ear level when in the seated listening position. This ensures an enhanced stereo image and an accurate frequency response. • Avoid placing speakers directly against walls. Maintain a certain distance to minimize unwanted effects from acoustic reflections off surrounding surfaces. As full range speakers they can be largely used in home entertainment and home cinema applications, including Dolby Surround and Atmos configurations. Domino-KF26C has specially designed to be used in immersive surround configurations as surround 5.1. or Atmos configurations where they can be installed as surround channels or overheads. All the Domino-KF are available in marine version as Domino- KFM. Thanks to special treatments and coating they are suitable for marine applications and when installed in demanding weather conditions they highly resist oxidation and are completely sealed from water infiltration. For diverse outdoor applications that requires an elevate IP grade, all the Domino-KF speakers can be equipped with dedicated K-KUIP accessories, purchased separately. * 2x in the Domino-KF26/KF26M/KF26C/KF26CM package 4x in the Domino-KF210/KF210M and Domino-KF212/KF212M package.

In order to select the proper loudspeaker impedance, the four terminals of the flying plug shall be wired as described below. LOW-Z HIGH-Z Domino-KF26 8 Ω 32 Ω Domino-KF26C FIXED - 8Ω / Domino-KF210 8 Ω 32 Ω Domino-KF212 FIXED - 8 Ω / Please note that Domino-KF212 has a fixed impedance of 8 Ω, be sure to follow the proper wiring configuration. LOW Impedance Wiring Always check the loudspeaker impedance before connecting the amplifier. HIGH Impedance Wiring Amplifier Channel Matching The number of Domino-KF loudspeakers that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Before connecting the speaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP. Domino-KFC26 The Domino-KF26C and Domino-KF26CM full range speakers feature Euroblock 2 pin inlets, for Phoenix 2,5/ 2-ST-5,08 compatible flying plug. The speaker shall be wired as explained in the picture below. The impedance is set at 8Ω fixed-Z.

With the dedicated mounting frame, the Domino-KF26/KF26C/ KF26M, Domino-KF210 and Domino-KF212 can be installed in a recessed position, either in-wall and in-ceiling. Free-Standing Installation The Domino-KF feature four rubber feet screwed on the bottom side. The rubber feet can be adjusted along the four M4 threaded holes located on the sides of the loudspeaker, allowing the user to tilt the speaker for vertical free-standing. Any Domino-KF loudspeaker has an on-board passive filter that automatically adjusts the frequency response and phase response of the speaker and can be match with any professional amplifier. It means that can be driven without the need of a dedicated preset. Especially in this case, make sure to adhere to the correct wiring and the correct impedance configuration The following installation procedures can be applied to both the Domino-KF26 I, the Domino-KF210 and the Domino-KF212 even if the pictures show theDomino-KF210 only.

To have a coherent image and sound coverage, as point source full-range speakers they can be placed as follow: • Position the speakers at a height where the tweeters align with ear level when in the seated listening position. This ensures an enhanced stereo image and an accurate frequency response. • Avoid placing speakers directly against walls. Maintain a certain distance to minimize unwanted effects from acoustic reflections off surrounding surfaces. As full range speakers they can be largely used in home entertainment and home cinema applications, including Dolby Surround and Atmos configurations. Domino-KF26C has specially designed to be used in immersive surround configurations as surround 5.1. or Atmos configurations where they can be installed as surround channels or overheads. All the Domino-KF are available in marine version as Domino- KFM. Thanks to special treatments and coating they are suitable for marine applications and when installed in demanding weather conditions they highly resist oxidation and are completely sealed from water infiltration. For diverse outdoor applications that requires an elevate IP grade, all the Domino-KF speakers can be equipped with dedicated K-KUIP accessories, purchased separately. * 2x in the Domino-KF26/KF26M/KF26C/KF26CM package 4x in the Domino-KF210/KF210M and Domino-KF212/KF212M package.

In order to select the proper loudspeaker impedance, the four terminals of the flying plug shall be wired as described below. LOW-Z HIGH-Z Domino-KF26 8 Ω 32 Ω Domino-KF26C FIXED - 8Ω / Domino-KF210 8 Ω 32 Ω Domino-KF212 FIXED - 8 Ω / Please note that Domino-KF212 has a fixed impedance of 8 Ω, be sure to follow the proper wiring configuration. LOW Impedance Wiring Always check the loudspeaker impedance before connecting the amplifier. HIGH Impedance Wiring Amplifier Channel Matching The number of Domino-KF loudspeakers that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Before connecting the speaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP. Domino-KFC26 The Domino-KF26C and Domino-KF26CM full range speakers feature Euroblock 2 pin inlets, for Phoenix 2,5/ 2-ST-5,08 compatible flying plug. The speaker shall be wired as explained in the picture below. The impedance is set at 8Ω fixed-Z.

To have a coherent image and sound coverage, as point source full-range speakers they can be placed as follow: • Position the speakers at a height where the tweeters align with ear level when in the seated listening position. This ensures an enhanced stereo image and an accurate frequency response. • Avoid placing speakers directly against walls. Maintain a certain distance to minimize unwanted effects from acoustic reflections off surrounding surfaces. As full range speakers they can be largely used in home entertainment and home cinema applications, including Dolby Surround and Atmos configurations. Domino-KF26C has specially designed to be used in immersive surround configurations as surround 5.1. or Atmos configurations where they can be installed as surround channels or overheads. All the Domino-KF are available in marine version as Domino- KFM. Thanks to special treatments and coating they are suitable for marine applications and when installed in demanding weather conditions they highly resist oxidation and are completely sealed from water infiltration. For diverse outdoor applications that requires an elevate IP grade, all the Domino-KF speakers can be equipped with dedicated K-KUIP accessories, purchased separately. * 2x in the Domino-KF26/KF26M/KF26C/KF26CM package 4x in the Domino-KF210/KF210M and Domino-KF212/KF212M package.

In order to select the proper loudspeaker impedance, the four terminals of the flying plug shall be wired as described below. LOW-Z HIGH-Z Domino-KF26 8 Ω 32 Ω Domino-KF26C FIXED - 8Ω / Domino-KF210 8 Ω 32 Ω Domino-KF212 FIXED - 8 Ω / Please note that Domino-KF212 has a fixed impedance of 8 Ω, be sure to follow the proper wiring configuration. LOW Impedance Wiring Always check the loudspeaker impedance before connecting the amplifier. HIGH Impedance Wiring Amplifier Channel Matching The number of Domino-KF loudspeakers that can be connected in parallel to the same amplifier channel depends on the loudspeaker model, loudspeaker impedance and amplifier power. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance: caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Please refer to the Amplifier-to-Speaker matching table available on K-array website for details about the maximum number of loudspeakers that can be driven by a single amplifier channel. Before connecting the speaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated load impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel; • load the dedicated loudspeaker factory preset on the amplifier DSP. Domino-KFC26 The Domino-KF26C and Domino-KF26CM full range speakers feature Euroblock 2 pin inlets, for Phoenix 2,5/ 2-ST-5,08 compatible flying plug.

{"content": "Gravity Tech Home Automation worked with K-array to design and install an outdoor audio system, as well as a home theater and AV system in a Private Luxury Estate. Gravity Tech chose to use K- array for this Private Luxury Estate in Ontario audio system because of the outdoor capabilities of K-array speakers and compact size for the interiors which could blend easily into the exquisite environment. Control 4 is at the heart of a sophisticated home automation that not only includes an outdoor audio system design, whole-house AV system and home theater but also lighting, security and advanced controls such as automated shades and water shut-off capabilities. The entire backyard of the property includes a pool, cabana, patio, a lounging area, and even the veranda of the owner’s master bedroom where there is a hot tub. Two Kobra-KK52 together with Rumble-KU210s were a perfect choice to meet the sound coverage required for the outdoor area. In order to achieve the necessary system coverage results with the original outdoor audio system that was specified, the design called for 20 satellite speakers and four subwoofers. However, Gravity Tech was able to simplify the system by installing four of K-array’s Python-KP102 line array speakers, along with two Rumble-KU212 subwoofers for low-frequency support. It created the feeling of dedicated audio zones by the pool and the power to turn it up for special occasions. Concerning the indoor home theatre there's a lot of challenges that system integrators face such as the loss of cohesive audio in the larger rooms. In order to create that breathtaking immersive audio experience, Gravity Tech installed three Thunder-KSC18P subwoofers and five Thunder-KMT12P. The use of 18-inch subwoofers is fairly unique in a home environment but once you experience it, you will never go back. The passive Thunder-KSC18P utilizes a single 18-inch high-excursion woofer in a small bass-reflex cabinet. Kayman-KY102s guarantee an optimal and uniform audio diffusion of a movie where each breath or inflection of the voice of the actors' narration can be so clear. “The products look good while blending into a range of indoor and outdoor environments. We like the combination of the company’s industrial designs, slim, room-friendly footprints, and array of color choices helps to ease the concerns of homeowners, interior designers and architects that may be skeptical of having installed AV systems in home spaces.” Going into the home theater, especially using the line arrays, you’re able to cover very large distances. What you would experience normally (in a room of this size) is a lack of quality audio as you move from the back to the front of the theater. Usually, one central spot is dedicated as the optimal spot of the theater, with K-array, we were actually able to create an entire audio experience no matter where you sit in that theater", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/private-luxury-estate", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.679158"}, "embedding": null}

The entire speaker system of K-array, decoding and control system was designed and installed by Con Bao So to meet the versatile needs, including watching movies, showing TVC, giving presentations, training, and performing music when necessary. The items utilized in the project are carefully chosen because the project is situated in a coastal region with significant humidity. The K-array speaker system is the ideal option since it satisfies all the stringent criteria that Digital Storm set throughout the project design phase. The K-array speaker system has a stainless steel casing, making it long-lasting despite high humidity and air erosion from sea salt. Compact speaker design that is simple to set up behind a screen. The inner space is unaffected by this arrangement. The speaker system's audio performance, along with a DSP-cum-power amplifier that enables extensive fine-tuning, makes the overall setup appropriate for most audio purposes, including performing music and watching movies. A 16:9 curved screen with a maximum width of 7m was created by Con Bao So to complement the hemispheric layout of the hall. The sound from the speaker system behind the screen can be heard via the neutral white curtain fabric's minute holes. Operation is another crucial element that can't be overlooked for expert AV projects. . All system controls fit on an 11-inch touchscreen interface, with pre-programmed contexts.

{"content": "When billionaire and owner of Nordic Hotels and Resorts, Petter Stordalen, wanted to open a new flagship hotel and cultural hub, he set his eyes on the historic building of ‘Gamle Oslo Lysverker’. Dating back to the 1930s, the Old Oslo Lightworks once housed the first electricity distribution centre in Oslo, before later serving as the largest indoor pool and spa in the city, the Vestkantbadet. In a restoration project that costs over 250 million euros, this extensive building has been meticulously restored in cooperation with the director of cultural heritage in Oslo. No less than 231 rooms and suites, a full medical spa and pool area with adjoining gym, a rooftop sauna and swimming pool, six restaurants, seven event halls, multiple meeting rooms, a library, a movie theatre, a piano bar, and two live stages are available both to guests staying at the hotel and people wanting to drop in for both business and pleasure. These facilities required an extensive AV system that would remain discreet and maintain the 1930s-style décor, including original Per Krogh frescoes. Oslo-based technology experts, Bravo, led the integration process, working closely with renowned designers, Grecodeco. Audio technology for the project was supplied by local distributor, First Audio. A total of 295 K-array & KGEAR products were deployed, making the Sommerro project the largest K-array installation to date. “The goal was to transform this legacy building into a cultural hub with a hotel, restaurant, bars, conference halls, concert venue, a spa with swimming pool, roof terrace and a cinema,” explains Espen Siverts. “The client brief demanded a variety of sound solutions that needed to meet the functions of the spaces, whilst adhering to the regulations in place to preserve the original architecture – this was a key challenge.” A full K-array system was specified, chosen for its discreetness and wide range of models to fit the variety of use cases throughout the Sommerro. “K-array products were ideal for this project,” confirms Siverts. “The variety of sizes, models and finishes available allowed us to build a system that could meet the listening expectations of the end user without compromising on aesthetics.” Sommerro Oslo offers spaces for those looking to work, stay or play. Culinary experiences are abundant, with four unique restaurants and two bars to choose from. One of these is the Ekspedisjonshallen, offering all-day brasserie-style dining. The space features a wall fresco by Norwegian artist Per Krogh, so maintaining the aesthetics of the restaurant was of high priority. The dining hall hosts a live band every weekend, followed by a late-evening DJ, so these requirements were also taken into consideration during specification. Here, the installation comprises ten Python half-metre line array loudspeakers and four ultra-flat K-array Vyper loudspeakers, alongside four K-array Rumble and two Thunder subwoofers to enhance the low-frequency range. The system is driven by a single Kommander-KA208 amplifier. From culinary to cultural delights, the Sommerro boasts an on-site cinema, library room and theatre space. The cinema - which features 28 comfy deep-tufted art deco lounge chairs and offers regular screenings of everything from Norwegian and foreign films to timeless classics - called for an immersive audio system. A Yamaha RX-A8A Musiccast receiver serves as the central hub, providing connectivity and control for the entire audio setup. The main audio system is comprised of three K-array Python metre-long line array elements (LCR), plus r half-metre loudspeakers for surround sound. Amplification is provided by K-array's Kommander-KA34 and Kommander-KA104. Movies are shown on a 138-inch LG LED screen. The wellness floor at Sommerro, aptly named Vestkantbadet, after the public swimming pool originally at the site, is a 1400-square-metre space comprising an infrared sauna, cold plunge pool and a state-of-the-art gym. Soothing background music is provided through three K-array Domino-KF26 loudspeakers, driven by a Kommander-KA14 amplifier, whilst two Spherina Air pendulum loudspeakers ensure even sound distribution. Meanwhile, in the Gym area, music is reproduced through eight Vyper-KV25 slimline loudspeakers. Complementing these are four KU44 Rumble subwoofers. Finally, two Domino loudspeakers complete the system, offering consistent audio coverage throughout the space. Again, all loudspeakers are driven by a Kommander series amplifier. Much of the third floor is dedicated to a series of meeting rooms, each with a unique interior styling, but all boasting top-of-the-line AV systems, including K-array’s Azimut Professional Sound System, composed of two 25cm-long Vyper loudspeakers, an ultra-compact Truffle-KTR26 subwoofer and a Kommander-KA02 amplifier. Visuals are provided through a 77-inch OLED TV with video conferencing via a Bose VB1 video bar. In the guest rooms, stylish interiors take centre stage, with Azimut Sound Systems deployed in the four most luxurious suites. Furthermore, each suite is also equipped with a Samsung 75-inch 4K TV and Bose VB1 video bar. “K-array’s unique and discreet loudspeakers were the key to providing a solution that met both the sound quality expectations and the restrictions from the interior architect,” reflects Eivind Vierli, Project Manager at Bravo. “We could not have realised this project so successfully with another brand.” Since opening, the cultural and culinary offerings at Somerro Olso have garnered much attention. In a review of the Sommerro’s 8th-floor restaurant, Tak, one Aftenposten food critic remarked, “The background music is at a suitable level - the integrator delivering the audio in this building has done an excellent job. Here you can easily hear the music, the people around you, and what your waiter is saying”. The result is a modern tribute to Norwegian cultural heritage, an open house and a community hub. “Today, the Sommero is full of people enjoying a variety of high-end AV systems in beautiful surroundings, from live concerts to pool-side background music,” concludes Siverts. “The project was a huge success and the Sommero is a must-visit destination in the heart of the historic Frogner neighbourhood.”", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/sommerro-hotel-oslo", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.679173"}, "embedding": null}

To have a coherent image and sound coverage, as point source full-range speakers they can be placed as follow: • Position the speakers at a height where the tweeters align with ear level when in the seated listening position. This ensures an enhanced stereo image and an accurate frequency response. • Avoid placing speakers directly against walls. Maintain a certain distance to minimize unwanted effects from acoustic reflections off surrounding surfaces. As full range speakers they can be largely used in home entertainment and home cinema applications, including Dolby Surround and Atmos configurations. Domino-KF26C has specially designed to be used in immersive surround configurations as surround 5.1. or Atmos configurations where they can be installed as surround channels or overheads. All the Domino-KF are available in marine version as Domino- KFM. Thanks to special treatments and coating they are suitable for marine applications and when installed in demanding weather conditions they highly resist oxidation and are completely sealed from water infiltration.

{"content": "Eduardo Gutierrez knows a thing or two about good sound from working in one of Ibiza’s legendary nightclubs. So when it came to equipping Migas Mercado, his new Spanish restaurant and music venue in Beijing, he turned to K-array. Migas Mercado recently moved to China World Mall in central Beijing from its previous location with the iconic CCTV building and city skyline providing the terrace backdrop, which stages al fresco nightly DJ sets. Sound requirements for the bar/restaurant was to have decent SPLs while ensuring that conversation could still flow, and speaker cabinets didn’t overwhelm the décor. Additionally, a raised VIP dining room which doubles as a stage for regular live music nights needed to be suitably equipped. Four Kobra-KK102 loudspeakers, four Kobra-KK52 loudspeakers, two Rumble-KU212 double 12-inch subs, two Rumble-KU210 double 10-inch subs, and two Rumble-KU26 double 6-inch subs were installed in the venue. 6 Tornado-KT2 2-inch point sources speakers provide extra coverage where needed. The entire indoor system is powered by Kommander-KA14, KA24 and KA84 amplifiers. Outdoors, a further eight Kobra-KK52 line arrays and four Rumble-KU210 subs have been teamed up with four Domino-KF212 double 12-inch full range speakers and four Thunder-KMT18P 18-inch subs driven by Kommander-KA24 and KA84 amps. The system has been zoned into four areas for restaurant background music, indoor DJs, terrace DJs and live music from the stage, respectively. Control over the individual zones was accomplished via the use of Kommander amplifiers used to power the system. Thanks to the digital processor inside all our amps, so we can easily carry out signal routing as well as adjusting the level and the EQ. Outside, the Dominos can provide full range sound in nearfield. It's a traditional design but using neodymium magnetic drivers, so while the cabinet is thin, it's very powerful.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/migas", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.679285"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "The Meat Co. is an African steakhouse chain with a location in the popular shopping district in Dubai's Souk Madinat Jumeirah. The venue has recently reopened with a change to its look and as part of the upgrade, distributor Procom Middle East installed a new audio system for BGM, DJ and band use, with a K-array system. The interior makeover was intended to compliment the restaurant’s stunning views of the Madinat’s blue waters and the Burj Al Arab, therefore, the speakers had to be visually compatible with the luxurious design, yet suitable for fine dining purposes. Six Kobra-KK102 line array speakers were selected due to their linear design, which offered even sound dispersion across the dining areas without disturbing customers seated close to the speakers. They were paired with four Thunder-KMT12 subwoofers. As the bar area required more power, the team chose to install four Dragon-KX12 loudspeakers and Thunder-KMT21 subwoofers due to their high SPL which better suits live band performances. For the outdoor areas, Procom installed eight Domino-KF26s. The entire solution was powered by two Kommander-KA24 amplifier and a single Kommander-KA14 amplifier.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/meat-company-dubai", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.679350"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Iris bars can be found in the world's gateway cities and has been described as a modern lounge bar bringing an elegant, natural, sensuous and free-spirited experience. Since the first lounge launched in Beirut in 2010, they have been a hot spot for memorable DJ events, cocktails and high profile parties. Iris recently migrated to a new site in Meydan, Dubai. With many signature traits, there is one universal key ingredient that remains a top contributing factor to Iris' major success - great sounding audio. Procom Middle East, local distributor, handled the complete audio integration from design to execution and technical support, and like the other outlets, the venue called on K-array to meet their high expectations. The venue goes beyond the typical late-night DJ sets and provides both a Friday brunch service and live band music at various times, all of which provide a different set of requirements for the audio system. “We had to create an audio system that could cater to in excess of 2,000 customers and that offered enough power and punch for an outdoor venue while still remaining in control of many additional factors such as noise pollution and key design elements” The large open-air space is an unusual shape and is divided into several sections with seating spread all around. There are five bars, high tables, lounges and two areas reserved for VIPs – all centered around a centralized view of downtown Dubai and the Burj Khalifa. Iris suffers from extra restrictive noise regulations. As such, Procom had to pay extra attention in the design to limiting outside transmission: the system was designed by very carefully taking into account noise restrictions in the area, installing a system that has all the coverage and power requirements of a club installation and yet still meet the noise restriction requirements of the area. K-array’s Dragon-KX12 cabinet was central to the project. Outputting up to 132dB, Dragon provided amble SPL for the Iris lounge and ticked all of the boxes in terms of its compact size and sleek aesthetic. The floor area and main bar have been outfitted with four pairs of Dragon-KX12 finished in black to match the venue’s trademark pillars. These have been paired with 18-inch Thunder-KMT18 subwoofers tucked out of sight. The four additional sidebars have been catered to with five Dragon-KX12 and five Thunder-KMT218. Here, Python-KP52 column loudspeaker has also been wall-mounted to provide additional coverage. The large VIP section features twelve Python-KP52 spread uniformly throughout. Four Thunder-KMT18 subwoofers generate the necessary low-end for this area. Away from the main rooftop, Procom integrated twelve Tornado-KT2C speakers into the ceiling for the wine cellar. Iris Dubai’s expansion has seen a complete new indoor venue with sound, light and video. Eighteen Dragon-KX12 passive speakers along with five Thunder-KMT21 and eight Thunder-KMT218 active subs were installed throughout the venue. All controlled by Symetrix, using Prism 8×8 digital signal processor, a control server and xControl external control expander. The DJ monitor system consists of two Thunder-KMT21 and two Dragon-KX12 passive speakers. Noise requirements, level checks, and site readings were taking and used regularly during the design process to ensure the neighboring residential areas would not be disturbed. As with the previous outlets, the Iris management could not be happier with the work done by Procom.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/\\en", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.679358"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "Located on the southern side of Dubai Creek, Al Seef is a modern shopping strip with a distinctive shipping container-style design along a 1.8-km stretch of prime waterfront real estate. One of its latest restaurants to open is Kailish Parbat, serving Indian vegetarian cuisine. The spilt-level property has an open kitchen dining concept for families downstairs, while a bar entices patrons of a different persuasion with a live house band and DJ. With an outdoor rooftop area adding further diversity, the musical ambience was regarded as a vital part of the furnishings from the outset. As such, Procom Middle East was called upon to fulfil the entertainment technology requirements. The distributors were tasked to provide a high-power audio system that would be sleek and elegant in its design for the different needs of the three distinctive zones of the restaurant: background music, live and DJ. While providing more of a club feel upstairs, Procom had to be mindful of the neighbors, including the Saudi Arabian consulate, especially since the Al Seef developer enforced high standards upon its tenants, including strict building and electrical regulations together with lighting and noise pollution enforcements. To meet all these requirements, the team selected K-array loudspeaker systems for the indoor and outdoor zones. Within the club, DJs presiding over the Pioneer DDJ-SZ2 decks and live performers are reinforced by four ceiling-fixed Dragon-KX12 coaxial speakers thundered in the low frequencies to 30Hz by a pair of floor-standing KMT21 21-inch subwoofers. However, a more sensitive solution was required outdoors and, as such, five KK52 speakers fixed onto trusses by clamps are boosted by a pair of KMT18 subwoofers to provide the perfect accompaniment to spice, beer and tobacco. Located in the DJ booth, the upstairs passive speaker system is powered by single K-array Kommander-KA24 and KA84 amplifiers so should the owners wish to expand this current system, these two amplifiers still possess spare channels.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/kailish-restaurant", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.679419"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "More and more frequently the managers of restaurants, bars and, above all, nightclubs are requesting audio systems that comply with regulations that ensure a reduction in noise pollution, especially in areas with high residential density, hence solutions that minimize the emission of sound energy in areas outside the dance floor. So when the managers of Tenax, the historic Florentine nightclub founded in 1981 that is considered one of the most famous nightclubs in Italy, decided to invest in the renewal of the audio system, aware that it was now necessary to keep up with the technological developments of the professional audio industry, K-array was ready with a solution. For the main PA, a system consisting of 8 Firenze-KH7 divided into 4 clusters of 2 elements was assisted by 6 sub Firenze-KS8 subwoofers. A system dedicated to the DJ console comprised of a stereo system of 2 active 18” Thunder-KMT218 double cone subwoofers, each of which drives 2 adjustable Dragon-KX12 12” coaxial speakers to meet the needs of the DJs and guarantees the artist the same feeling and sound pressure as on the dance floor. The new sound system at Tenax does not stop at the dance floor, but also the private rooms have been renewed using K-array technology: an Axle-KRX402 system, consisting of two Thunder-KMT21 subwoofers with 21 \"cones and four coaxial Dragon-KX12 speakers finds a new configuration, as the Dragons are installed on the corners of the VIP dance floor and the subwoofers are encased under the DJ console. The seating area of privé is completed with the installation of 3 Kobra-KK52 column loudspeakers and a KN10S subwoofer; a system that guarantees directivity to the sound emission to selectively cover the table area and not interfere with the surrounding areas. The Gold privé area is equipped with the same technology: 4 Kobra-KK52 column loudspeakers and two KN10S subwoofers. The installation concludes with the bathroom which, following the trend of other international clubs, will provide a high-quality audio experience, thanks to the installation of 8 Lyzard-KZ14 speakers, assisted by 3 Rumble-KU26 subwoofers – a discreet, IP54, high-performance system in an unusual configuration that will amaze many clubgoers.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/tenax", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.679448"}, "embedding": null}

Both versions offer multichannel free routing and DSP with features such as grouping, input and output equalizers, level adjustment, dynamic limiters, and 4-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA14 I 4 4 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA34 4 4 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA104 4 4 2500W @ 4Ω 8-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA18 8 8 150W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA28 8 8 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA68 8 8 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA208 8 8 2500W @ 4Ω delay per channel. The key difference between IEB and IEB-pro is the expanded networking capabilities of the IEB-pro. These networking features are compatible with various professional audio protocols for managing digital audio streams, ensuring seamless integration with existing technologies and providing an optimal experience for integrators and system engineers. Network Types and Audio Protocols Standard IEB (Integrated Electronic Brain) The standard IEB includes one network port with fast Ethernet connection (1 Gigabit / 1.000 Mbps) and standard Wi-Fi with an internal access point. Wi-Fi connection can be extended through a router and amplifiers connected in Wi-Fi Client Mode. The physical network connection allows remote control via Ethernet and enables the following physical network topologies: • Standard Star Topology - (Control only - Wi-Fi switched off) • Standard Star topology - Control and DANTE network (primary network without redundancy - Wi-Fi switched off). With a single wired Ethernet connection, both control and audio streams are integrated into the same network flow. IEB-Pro The IEB-Pro is equipped with a 2-port network switch featuring Ethernet connections (1 Gigabit / 1000 Mbps), but does not include Wi-Fi capability. The supported network topologies are as follows: • Star Network Topology - Control only - amplifiers in single- port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante sharing the same network (amplifiers in single-port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante Redundancy (amplifiers in single port mode - redundancy requires two fully separated networks); • Star Network Topology - with Control and Dante Splitted( amplifiers in single-port mode) - split requires two fully separated networks; • Daisy Chain Network with Control (amplifiers set in bridge- mode) - not recommended for DanteTM. For more information on Dante network topologies and primary/ secondary port configurations, please refer to the dedicated chapter on DANTE network.

Since every host on a network must be identified by a unique IP address, the simplest local network usually implements a router/switch with a DHCP server managing the addresses allocation: by default the Kommander‑KA unit is set to obtain a local IP address from the DHCP server. In case a DHCP server is not present on the LAN, the unit goes in Auto IP mode: in few seconds the amplifier automatically self- assigns an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16. A static IP address can be assigned to the amplifier unit using the amplifier’s embedded web app (Network menu). It is possible to connect to the amplifiers wired to the switch via a Wi-Fi access point and configure them using the K-Connect app on a mobile device. Please ensure that the access point is connected to the same local network (LAN) as the switch to allow communication between all devices. When amplifiers are connected to the network via Ethrnet cables, it is recommended to disable the amplifiers built-in Wi-Fi hot- spot.

Kommander-KA User Guide 20 Network topology and network requirements Single Network - Star Topology Control + Digital Audio Streaming A star network configuration for single network amplifiers allows both remote control and digital audio streaming to run over the same network, providing centralized management and high-quality audio distribution. This setup ensures reliable performance and optimal bandwidth allocation for complex audio systems. A. First connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration and using ETH1 port. B. The same network configuration is used to control the amplifiers and utilize the Digital Audio Stream simultaneously. Single Network - Daisy Chain Control ONLY Daisy chaining network amplifiers allows multiple devices to be connected in daisy chain using a single network cable, streamlining installation and minimizing the need for additional switches. This configuration is ideal for remote control of amplifiers in multi-zone systems; however, it is not recommended for transmitting digital audio streams, as it may restrict bandwidth and degrade signal quality. Connecting the First Amplifier: 3. Connect the EHT1 port of the first amplifier to an external switch or network source. 4. Set the first amplifier to bridge mode. 5. Connect the EHT2 port of the first amplifier to the EHT1 port of the second amplifier. 6. Continue this pattern, connecting the EHT2 port of each amplifier to the EHT1 port of the next amplifier. Kommander-KA+ The Kommander-KA+ are equipped with the IEB-Pro platform, which, as we have seen, includes a switch with 2 ports for Ethernet-wired connections but does not have built-in Wi-Fi. Therefore, the primary access and control methods must be through a local network connected with Ethernet cables to a dedicated switch. • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel. The managing control softwares are the embedded Web- app, K-monitor or K-framework. Network settings (with DanteTM) • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel • disable the ENABLE AUTOIP function in the network tab. • Avoid Daisy-Chain if working with DanteTM. (Audinate, the manufacturer, does not recommend daisy-chaining through more than two hops, as this can cause latency issues and potentially disrupt the audio stream.) See the DanteReadyTM paragraph to more details. Built-in Wi-Fi is not present on KA+ - direct Wi-Fi connection is not possible - connection via an access point on the same LAN is supported for K-Connect use.

Kommander-KA User Guide 34 K-framework3 Kommander-KA amplifiers can be remotely controlled with the dedicated K-framework3 software available for PC and MAC on K-array website. K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units in demanding applications. The K-framework3 operates in three modes: • 3D – Design a loudspeaker system for your venue in a full 3D environment and make free field acoustic simulations in these mode it is also possible to load FIR filters in the EBS menu for systems operating in Electronic Beam Steering and view the actual simulation of the sound beam orientation (frequency response) based on the listening area; • SETUP – import from the 3D design the active components into the workspace or build from scratch a PA system composed of active loudspeakers and amplifiers; use the input and output groups to allow full control of the system; Scheduler The new web app and OsKar update also enable advanced electronics management and scheduling. The Scheduler, which implements the NTP protocol, allows functions to be set at specific times to configure the Kommander-KA. Multiroom smart control Kommander-KA offers the ability to manage and distribute different audio signals across multiple zones, delivering them to a network of connected speakers placed in various areas. Users can control and manage the audio content in each zone via the web app’s matrix or the K-control app—a user-friendly interface designed for smart home control. The system also K-framework3 WINDOWS and OSX software Sidebar Toolbar Workspace Menu bar Kommander-KA User Guide 35 • TUNING – Manage and control the loudspeaker system in real time: optimize the performance of the loudspeaker system during the tuning session and control its behavior in live events. K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on- line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. K-framework3 allows to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available, or import from scratch in the workspace the real active loudspeakers and amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology.* The network shall comprise of: • single PC or MAC, running the K-framework3 software with network interface 100Mbps (or higher); • router with DHCP server 100Mbps (or higher); • Ethernet switch 100Mbps (or higher); • Cat5 (or higher) Ethernet cables. A DHCP server is highly recommended even if the device units implement the zeroconf network technologies: if a DHCP service is not available, every device will self assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16 (auto-IP). Discovery 1. Ensure that all the units and the PC/Mac running the K-framework3 are properly connected to the same network. 2. Power up the units. 3. Launch K-framework3. 4. Open the Network window and launch the discovery: • If K-framework3 finds two or more devices with the wrong ID, a dialog window appears where unique IDs can be assigned to the units. 5. Once discovered, the real units are shown in the left columns, following the order of their ID number; if the workspace contains virtual devices of the same type you can eventually modify the IDs in order to match the units and allows the synchronization. The synchronization can be in either directions: Workspace-to-Real or Real-to- Workspace. Select the sync direction and synchronize all or the single units separately 3D simulation In the 3D simulation mode of K-Framework 3, you can position systems and speakers at precise height and distance coordinates. The system then calculates sound emission and simulates sound pressure levels based on these coordinates and the defined dimensions of the listening area, allowing for accurate configuration and adjustment.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13958", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.679951"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "A new 24-storey corporate building in Saudi Arabia asked the consultant and integrator for the ‘best of everything’. Saudi Arabia’s Basic Industries Corporation, known as SABIC, is a Saudi chemical manufacturing company, 70% owned by Saudi Aramco. As part of an expansion programme, the company has built a huge new building in the city of Jubail, covering a total land area of 66,000 sq m, the building will eventually accommodate more than 3,600 employees. It was built using SABIC steel, and 77% of the building’s mechanical, electrical and finishing works were made locally. The scale, as we’ve come to expect in Saudi Arabia, is breathtaking. The huge complex is home to a 24-storey tower, two 15-floor and 13-floor office blocks, a data centre, an auditorium for more than 1,000 people, a mosque to accommodate 1,000 worshippers, and open workspaces and areas that can accommodate more than 1,500 people. The building is LEED Gold certified for energy efficiency and uses more than 1,500 solar panels to generate the entire energy used in lighting the recreation centre and parking lots. Visitors and staff can eat at a two-floor cafeteria that accommodates up to 1,500 employees, along with 45 refreshment corners distributed in the various sections. It’s so vast it even has its own dedicated app (SABICOne) to help visitors and employees navigate their way around the various areas and facilities. With the financial backing you’d expect from one of the world’s most profitable companies, this new site has been completed on a ‘best of the best’ philosophy when it comes to AV technology too. First to be engaged from an AV standpoint was MiX Consultancy, who were selected by the M&E consultant (DSA engineering) and architect (Henning Larsen Architects) to join a design team to put together an initial design (the initial RFP dates back to April 2016). What was the original client brief to MiX? “It was ‘we want to be the best in breed’, ‘we want the best of everything’, ‘we want the best of the technology’,” says Sebastian Day, director of AV workplace services, MiX Consultancy. “They gave us use cases of what they wanted to get out of the spaces and how the building was going to be used. Then it was very much down to us to present solutions and recommendations back for the client to sign off.” What did the client want the AV to achieve in this project? It was several things, including the wow factor says Day. Because the initial plan was completed pre-Covid it included a requirement for technology to accommodate face-to-face meetings. Post-Covid this had to change explains Day, “Even though we had video-enabled every room (in the first design), we later put full Cisco video conferencing and Microsoft Teams in every single space. Another key requirement was around the different types of spaces, which had to fit in with SABIC’s culture, especially in making the technology work for some of those requirements. They had a lot of training and development laboratories in the plans, and we also needed to look at how they would collaborate and communicate outside of the building. The biggest feature was the auditorium space, it was a real showcase piece, they wanted to be able to deliver very successful keynote talks and deliver them in a very high quality way.” MiX was re-appointed some five years later once the majority of the building work had been completed to look over and modernise their initial design, as part of this second phase MiX worked with SABIC and Shapoorji Pallonji (the building contractor) to choose a suitable system integrator. After a tender process, Saudi-based integrator Samir Group, a company with a 70-year history, was chosen. Samir had the task of installing 229 rooms with AV, including 84 meeting rooms, 43 GM offices, 14 VIP offices, 38 classrooms and 34 collaboration spaces. As well as digital signage spread across 57 screens around the building. This vast amount of work was all done within a very tight timescale too, Samir Group began in July 2022 and everything had to be completed by a set date in November. The presentation rooms all feature Sharp/NEC screens ranging in size from 50-in to 98-in in LCD format and 137-in in LED format, wireless presentation is provided by Barco ClickShare, and video is supplied by Aver conference cameras. The back-end is provided by Lightware switchers and extenders. Audio is via Biamp meeting room bundles, which include Devio SCX 400 conference room hubs, ceiling microphones and ceiling speakers. Room control is handled by AMX Modero 10-in touchpanels and NX-220 control processors. All meeting rooms and presentation rooms can adhere to a demand for BYOD if required and feature an Extron Cable Cubby 700 in each meeting room table. An effort was made by MiX to standardise the AV whenever possible: “We worked through the floor plans with the client, and where they were similar, we looked to standardise. Obviously from the experience, and for consistency and training purposes it all has added benefits if you can standardise as much as possible across these spaces,” adds Day. The classrooms follow the same AV path, with added Sennheiser SpeechLine receivers, handheld mics and Ampetronic C52 hearing loop drivers, and feature Vaddio EasyIP 20 cameras instead of Aver. Digital signage and IPTV is handled throughout the building by Vitec, and digital signage displays are by Peerless-AV. The auditorium offers the wow factor in spades, with the centrepiece being a 28-metre by 5-metre videowall featuring 46 x 15 Sharp/NEC 1.9mm LED tiles. The production aspect of the auditorium is all run on the Newtek TriCaster 2 Elite platform and features NewTek 4Kp60 PTZ cameras, all using NDI to transmit signals. With a client wanting the best of the best, was it hard for MiX to not have any limits? “With the auditorium how far do you take it?” says Day. “I think we kept ourselves grounded in terms of what they wanted to achieve from the space. The key thing was flexibility, they wanted to integrate with Cisco, we brought in NDI to really give them that flexibility, but also some future proofing. There’s a lot of money to spend in that space to perhaps in three years have to put new technology in to meet new requirements as the space changes. We weren’t there to make them try and spend as much money as possible. We’re just there to make sure the spaces worked for them. And they continue to do so for five to seven years.” Audio in the auditorium is provided by K-array line array loudspeakers and amps, mics are a mix of Sennheiser handheld, lavalier, and gooseneck tabletop models. Control is via a mix of AMX and Cisco 10-in touchpanels. Video calls can be sent up to the big stage, and content can be recorded via an NewTek Remote Storage SNS 8-bay unit and streamed out to the internet if needed. Content on the giant videowall can be manipulated if required using a Dataton Watchpax 60 media server, and the display can be split into multiple different layout formats. A cueing system for presenters on the big stage is supplied via a MicroCue3 System, and four 50-in Sharp/NEC displays work as confidence monitors. Audio in the auditorium is mixed with an Allen & Heath mixer, with audio processing supplied by QSC. The 1,200 auditorium is used for both internal-only and external events, and even has its own control room nearby. With such broadcast-level facilities, it has become a powerful communication and broadcasting tool for SABIC moving forward. A project of this magnitude normally comes with some challenges, and this installation was no different. “There were three teams working in parallel, every team had a dependency – first a civil job had to be done, then the electrical job had to be done, then our job had to be done. Then it goes back to the civil team and they had to finish the closing works, and then we can install our devices. It was in loop and that was the biggest challenge,” says Mirza Mohibulla, engineering manager, Samir Group. Putting together such a large project, in a tight timescale would be difficult enough for Samir Group alone, were it not for the addition of the Covid pandemic and then the subsequent supply chain crisis that followed it. “You’re talking about almost 80 different suppliers, with a project of this magnitude you also need to hire subcontractors, so you’re communicating with different suppliers and arranging all the supply chain,” says Waddah Elrayyes, director, Samir Group. To manage this, Elrayyes instigated an early morning meeting every day on-site with his logistics department, “We had to make sure if there were any obstacles or issues when it came to delivery, we could overcome them because there was no room for delay. Delay was not acceptable on this project.” Like many projects that have happened in the last two years, the supply chain has seen integrators and consultants have to become more expansive when it comes to their choice of preferred manufacturers. “One of the big drivers here was not what we would like to do, but what could we actually do with what’s available?” says Ivo Kostandiev, lead system designer, MiX. Luckily the majority of the changes were not to critical pieces of equipment he adds: “All the major components that we specified were all there, it was an extender here and there, nothing that would actually fundamentally change our design.\" The combination of the supply chain crisis and the strictness of the project’s deadline meant that the only way the videowall, which was so crucial to the finished auditorium, could be delivered on time was to airlift the LED modules from China and the steel structure from Germany. The cost of that alone in dollars ran into six figures. But there is no doubt it was worth it, the end result is a stunning piece of architecture and AV design combined, which will serve SABIC and its employees well for decades to come. The desire was for the ‘best of the best’ and it delivers that and more. The result is even more incredible when you find out that the collaboration between the consultant (MiX) and the integrator (Samir Group) was done remotely without the presence of the consultant on site. “This highlights the power of AV technology in realisation of a common dream which spans millions of miles across the globe,” concludes Biju Abdul Latheef, national sales manager, Samir Group.

{"content": "Pier 5, a premier entertainment venue at Bayside Marketplace, has recently installed a comprehensive system featuring K-array products. The project, which was carried out by Miami based audiovisual company DRVCS AV, aimed to enhance the sound quality and coverage of the outdoor venue’s three bars, stage, and games deck. The new audio system consists of six Kayman-KY102 line array speakers on that stage, which deliver clear and powerful sound for the live events; two Thunder-KS5P I subwoofers and eight Thunder-KS3P I subwoofers, for a deep and immersive bass experience. Throughout the two bars and game deck area, 10 Python-KP102 I and 10 Python-KP52 I line array elements were installed, offering precise and uniform sound dispersion throughout the two bars and game deck. The entire system is powered by three K-array Kommander-KA208 amplifiers, which provide complete control over the loudspeakers with the K-array Connect mobile app that provides a user-friendly interface for remote control of the DSP main parameters and easy configuration of the signal routing. K-array speakers are inherently IP-rated for weather resistance however, the open-air tropical climate at Pier 5 called for an extra layer of protection. A custom marine-grade treatment was ordered to enhance protection against salt corrosion and humidity. This goes beyond standard IP ratings to ensure optimal performance and longevity in Miami's unique tropical climate. “We are very proud to have been chosen by Breakwater Hospitality Group and Pier 5 to upgrade their audio system with K-array solutions,” said Rusty Waite K-array USA President. “We believe that our products are the perfect fit for this venue, as they combine high performance, reliability, and aesthetics.

{"content": "Tenax, a beacon of the underground club scene in Florence, recently underwent a sonic upgrade with the installation of a new sound system from K-array. Boasting 43 years of continuous activity and a star-studded roster of performers including the likes of Daft Punk, Ben Harper, and Dream Theater, Tenax required a system that would live up to the club’s legendary reputation whilst honouring the requirements for low frequencies in a built-up urban area. The team at K-array worked directly with the in-house technicians at Tenax to design and implement the updated system. “Our headquarters are located just outside of Florence city, so we have strong connections with the nightclub and with the underground music culture that has evolved from Tenax over the decades,” explains Daniel Strasserra, Global Business Development Manager at K-array. “Whilst a key goal was to gain control over the audio and alleviate neighbourhood concerns, we were also tasked with designing a system that would do justice to the performances of the the best DJs in the business.” The main room at Tenax, located on the ground floor, required a system that would deliver audio with clarity and precision. Through collaboration with the Tenax in-house team, K-array recommended a large-scale system including 16 Mugello-KH3 tops and 20 Thunder-KS4 subs, powered by three Kommander-KA208 amplifiers. To mitigate noise pollution, 16 of the Thunder-KS4 subs have been strategically positioned in front of the sound booth to concentrate low frequencies in the centre of the dancefloor, leaving the side walls and adjoining buildings with minimal disruption. Additionally, the Mugello-KH3 tops are arranged in four clusters of four, enhancing sound dispersion and ensuring an immersive experience for dance-floor goers. The DJ booth monitoring system features four Thunder-KMT21 subs and six Dragon-KX12 tops configured in a left-centre-right format. This configuration, initially requested by Techno legend Jeff Mills, has since become the standard for monitoring systems in the main room, earning compliments from renowned DJs such as Steve Aoki, Black Coffee and Damian Lazarus.\"The results have garnered high praise from both the Tenax owners and by the many international artists who perform in the booth,” says Strasserra. “Importantly, the main room upgrade has been much appreciated by the neighbours, who no longer need to suffer from noise pollution on club nights.” On the first floor, dubbed “The Tube\", audio is delivered through two Thunder-KMT218 subs, four Dragon-KX12 tops and two Python-KP52s for delay coverage. Despite its small size \"The Tube\" has earned a reputation as the \"sweet spot\" of the club thanks to the powerful sound reinforcement that ensures a truly immersive clubbing experience. Like most modern nightclubs, Tenax offers several VIP areas. These areas, designated for private parties, have also been equipped with K-array and KGEAR audio solutions. VIP tables on the ground floor are installed with three GH12 loudspeakers from KGEAR, which take care of refreshing the mid-hi audio from the system in the main room, whilst Golden Tables on the first floor are reinforced with Kobra-KK50 tops and 3 KN10S subs, ensuring premium sound quality for the most discerning of Tenax guests. “The new K-array system perfectly meets the needs of the Tenax club,” confirms Alex Neri, Producer and Resident DJ at Tenax. “The definition of the high frequencies is nothing short of perfect and the new subs are amazing. For me, it's one of the best systems I've ever worked with in my 30-year career.\" “It’s been a pleasure to work with a legendary nightclub like Tenax and help them deliver an incredible clubbing experience,” concludes Strasserra. “We’re thrilled by the positive feedback received from the Tenax team and top DJs. The Tenax project is a testament to the ability of our products to not only provide quality audio but to also solve problems.”", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/tenax-nightclub", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.680024"}, "embedding": null}

Network Types and Audio Protocols Standard IEB (Integrated Electronic Brain) The standard IEB includes one network port with fast Ethernet connection (1 Gigabit / 1.000 Mbps) and standard Wi-Fi with an internal access point. Wi-Fi connection can be extended through a router and amplifiers connected in Wi-Fi Client Mode. The physical network connection allows remote control via Ethernet and enables the following physical network topologies: • Standard Star Topology - (Control only - Wi-Fi switched off) • Standard Star topology - Control and DANTE network (primary network without redundancy - Wi-Fi switched off). With a single wired Ethernet connection, both control and audio streams are integrated into the same network flow. IEB-Pro The IEB-Pro is equipped with a 2-port network switch featuring Ethernet connections (1 Gigabit / 1000 Mbps), but does not include Wi-Fi capability. The supported network topologies are as follows: • Star Network Topology - Control only - amplifiers in single- port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante sharing the same network (amplifiers in single-port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante Redundancy (amplifiers in single port mode - redundancy requires two fully separated networks); • Star Network Topology - with Control and Dante Splitted( amplifiers in single-port mode) - split requires two fully separated networks; • Daisy Chain Network with Control (amplifiers set in bridge- mode) - not recommended for DanteTM. For more information on Dante network topologies and primary/ secondary port configurations, please refer to the dedicated chapter on DANTE network.

Since every host on a network must be identified by a unique IP address, the simplest local network usually implements a router/switch with a DHCP server managing the addresses allocation: by default the Kommander‑KA unit is set to obtain a local IP address from the DHCP server. In case a DHCP server is not present on the LAN, the unit goes in Auto IP mode: in few seconds the amplifier automatically self- assigns an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16. A static IP address can be assigned to the amplifier unit using the amplifier’s embedded web app (Network menu). It is possible to connect to the amplifiers wired to the switch via a Wi-Fi access point and configure them using the K-Connect app on a mobile device. Please ensure that the access point is connected to the same local network (LAN) as the switch to allow communication between all devices. When amplifiers are connected to the network via Ethrnet cables, it is recommended to disable the amplifiers built-in Wi-Fi hot- spot.

Kommander-KA User Guide 20 Network topology and network requirements Single Network - Star Topology Control + Digital Audio Streaming A star network configuration for single network amplifiers allows both remote control and digital audio streaming to run over the same network, providing centralized management and high-quality audio distribution. This setup ensures reliable performance and optimal bandwidth allocation for complex audio systems. A. First connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration and using ETH1 port. B. The same network configuration is used to control the amplifiers and utilize the Digital Audio Stream simultaneously. Single Network - Daisy Chain Control ONLY Daisy chaining network amplifiers allows multiple devices to be connected in daisy chain using a single network cable, streamlining installation and minimizing the need for additional switches. This configuration is ideal for remote control of amplifiers in multi-zone systems; however, it is not recommended for transmitting digital audio streams, as it may restrict bandwidth and degrade signal quality. Connecting the First Amplifier: 3. Connect the EHT1 port of the first amplifier to an external switch or network source. 4. Set the first amplifier to bridge mode. 5. Connect the EHT2 port of the first amplifier to the EHT1 port of the second amplifier. 6. Continue this pattern, connecting the EHT2 port of each amplifier to the EHT1 port of the next amplifier. Kommander-KA+ The Kommander-KA+ are equipped with the IEB-Pro platform, which, as we have seen, includes a switch with 2 ports for Ethernet-wired connections but does not have built-in Wi-Fi. Therefore, the primary access and control methods must be through a local network connected with Ethernet cables to a dedicated switch. • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel. The managing control softwares are the embedded Web- app, K-monitor or K-framework. Network settings (with DanteTM) • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel • disable the ENABLE AUTOIP function in the network tab. • Avoid Daisy-Chain if working with DanteTM. (Audinate, the manufacturer, does not recommend daisy-chaining through more than two hops, as this can cause latency issues and potentially disrupt the audio stream.) See the DanteReadyTM paragraph to more details. Built-in Wi-Fi is not present on KA+ - direct Wi-Fi connection is not possible - connection via an access point on the same LAN is supported for K-Connect use.

By connecting the second network port of the amplifiers to a separate switch, a secondary or redundant network can be established, dedicated solely to the Dante™ audio streaming or other audio-over-IP protocols. This setup enhances system reliability and ensures uninterrupted audio performance. G. Connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration using ETH1 port. H. Connect each amplifier to a second switch via the EHT2 port. This setup creates a secondary or redundant network, ensuring a separate and reliable transmission path.

Kommander-KA User Guide 34 K-framework3 Kommander-KA amplifiers can be remotely controlled with the dedicated K-framework3 software available for PC and MAC on K-array website. K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units in demanding applications. The K-framework3 operates in three modes: • 3D – Design a loudspeaker system for your venue in a full 3D environment and make free field acoustic simulations in these mode it is also possible to load FIR filters in the EBS menu for systems operating in Electronic Beam Steering and view the actual simulation of the sound beam orientation (frequency response) based on the listening area; • SETUP – import from the 3D design the active components into the workspace or build from scratch a PA system composed of active loudspeakers and amplifiers; use the input and output groups to allow full control of the system; Scheduler The new web app and OsKar update also enable advanced electronics management and scheduling. The Scheduler, which implements the NTP protocol, allows functions to be set at specific times to configure the Kommander-KA. Multiroom smart control Kommander-KA offers the ability to manage and distribute different audio signals across multiple zones, delivering them to a network of connected speakers placed in various areas. Users can control and manage the audio content in each zone via the web app’s matrix or the K-control app—a user-friendly interface designed for smart home control. The system also K-framework3 WINDOWS and OSX software Sidebar Toolbar Workspace Menu bar Kommander-KA User Guide 35 • TUNING – Manage and control the loudspeaker system in real time: optimize the performance of the loudspeaker system during the tuning session and control its behavior in live events. K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on- line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. K-framework3 allows to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available, or import from scratch in the workspace the real active loudspeakers and amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology.* The network shall comprise of: • single PC or MAC, running the K-framework3 software with network interface 100Mbps (or higher); • router with DHCP server 100Mbps (or higher); • Ethernet switch 100Mbps (or higher); • Cat5 (or higher) Ethernet cables. A DHCP server is highly recommended even if the device units implement the zeroconf network technologies: if a DHCP service is not available, every device will self assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16 (auto-IP). Discovery 1. Ensure that all the units and the PC/Mac running the K-framework3 are properly connected to the same network. 2. Power up the units. 3. Launch K-framework3. 4. Open the Network window and launch the discovery: • If K-framework3 finds two or more devices with the wrong ID, a dialog window appears where unique IDs can be assigned to the units. 5. Once discovered, the real units are shown in the left columns, following the order of their ID number; if the workspace contains virtual devices of the same type you can eventually modify the IDs in order to match the units and allows the synchronization. The synchronization can be in either directions: Workspace-to-Real or Real-to- Workspace. Select the sync direction and synchronize all or the single units separately 3D simulation In the 3D simulation mode of K-Framework 3, you can position systems and speakers at precise height and distance coordinates. The system then calculates sound emission and simulates sound pressure levels based on these coordinates and the defined dimensions of the listening area, allowing for accurate configuration and adjustment.

Both versions offer multichannel free routing and DSP with features such as grouping, input and output equalizers, level adjustment, dynamic limiters, and 4-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA14 I 4 4 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA34 4 4 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA104 4 4 2500W @ 4Ω 8-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA18 8 8 150W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA28 8 8 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA68 8 8 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA208 8 8 2500W @ 4Ω delay per channel. The key difference between IEB and IEB-pro is the expanded networking capabilities of the IEB-pro. These networking features are compatible with various professional audio protocols for managing digital audio streams, ensuring seamless integration with existing technologies and providing an optimal experience for integrators and system engineers. Network Types and Audio Protocols Standard IEB (Integrated Electronic Brain) The standard IEB includes one network port with fast Ethernet connection (1 Gigabit / 1.000 Mbps) and standard Wi-Fi with an internal access point. Wi-Fi connection can be extended through a router and amplifiers connected in Wi-Fi Client Mode. The physical network connection allows remote control via Ethernet and enables the following physical network topologies: • Standard Star Topology - (Control only - Wi-Fi switched off) • Standard Star topology - Control and DANTE network (primary network without redundancy - Wi-Fi switched off). With a single wired Ethernet connection, both control and audio streams are integrated into the same network flow. IEB-Pro The IEB-Pro is equipped with a 2-port network switch featuring Ethernet connections (1 Gigabit / 1000 Mbps), but does not include Wi-Fi capability. The supported network topologies are as follows: • Star Network Topology - Control only - amplifiers in single- port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante sharing the same network (amplifiers in single-port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante Redundancy (amplifiers in single port mode - redundancy requires two fully separated networks); • Star Network Topology - with Control and Dante Splitted( amplifiers in single-port mode) - split requires two fully separated networks; • Daisy Chain Network with Control (amplifiers set in bridge- mode) - not recommended for DanteTM. For more information on Dante network topologies and primary/ secondary port configurations, please refer to the dedicated chapter on DANTE network.

Since every host on a network must be identified by a unique IP address, the simplest local network usually implements a router/switch with a DHCP server managing the addresses allocation: by default the Kommander‑KA unit is set to obtain a local IP address from the DHCP server. In case a DHCP server is not present on the LAN, the unit goes in Auto IP mode: in few seconds the amplifier automatically self- assigns an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16. A static IP address can be assigned to the amplifier unit using the amplifier’s embedded web app (Network menu). It is possible to connect to the amplifiers wired to the switch via a Wi-Fi access point and configure them using the K-Connect app on a mobile device. Please ensure that the access point is connected to the same local network (LAN) as the switch to allow communication between all devices. When amplifiers are connected to the network via Ethrnet cables, it is recommended to disable the amplifiers built-in Wi-Fi hot- spot.

Kommander-KA User Guide 20 Network topology and network requirements Single Network - Star Topology Control + Digital Audio Streaming A star network configuration for single network amplifiers allows both remote control and digital audio streaming to run over the same network, providing centralized management and high-quality audio distribution. This setup ensures reliable performance and optimal bandwidth allocation for complex audio systems. A. First connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration and using ETH1 port. B. The same network configuration is used to control the amplifiers and utilize the Digital Audio Stream simultaneously. Single Network - Daisy Chain Control ONLY Daisy chaining network amplifiers allows multiple devices to be connected in daisy chain using a single network cable, streamlining installation and minimizing the need for additional switches. This configuration is ideal for remote control of amplifiers in multi-zone systems; however, it is not recommended for transmitting digital audio streams, as it may restrict bandwidth and degrade signal quality. Connecting the First Amplifier: 3. Connect the EHT1 port of the first amplifier to an external switch or network source. 4. Set the first amplifier to bridge mode. 5. Connect the EHT2 port of the first amplifier to the EHT1 port of the second amplifier. 6. Continue this pattern, connecting the EHT2 port of each amplifier to the EHT1 port of the next amplifier. Kommander-KA+ The Kommander-KA+ are equipped with the IEB-Pro platform, which, as we have seen, includes a switch with 2 ports for Ethernet-wired connections but does not have built-in Wi-Fi. Therefore, the primary access and control methods must be through a local network connected with Ethernet cables to a dedicated switch. • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel. The managing control softwares are the embedded Web- app, K-monitor or K-framework. Network settings (with DanteTM) • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel • disable the ENABLE AUTOIP function in the network tab. • Avoid Daisy-Chain if working with DanteTM. (Audinate, the manufacturer, does not recommend daisy-chaining through more than two hops, as this can cause latency issues and potentially disrupt the audio stream.) See the DanteReadyTM paragraph to more details. Built-in Wi-Fi is not present on KA+ - direct Wi-Fi connection is not possible - connection via an access point on the same LAN is supported for K-Connect use.

CONTROL ONLY BRIDGE MODE A - B C - D Kommander-KA USER GUIDE 22 Dual-Network Configuration Primary / Secondary In a dual network configuration, both control signals and digital audio streaming are transmitted over the primary wired network, ensuring centralized management and efficient use of bandwidth. By connecting the second network port of the amplifiers to a separate switch, a secondary or redundant network can be established, dedicated solely to the Dante™ audio streaming or other audio-over-IP protocols. This setup enhances system reliability and ensures uninterrupted audio performance. G. Connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration using ETH1 port. H.

The default local Wi-Fi SSID and unit IP address are printed on a label located on the rear plate of the unit; a QR code for easing the connectivity is printed as well. The RJ45 Ethernet port on the rear panel allows to connect the unit to a local area network (LAN). Since every host on a network must be identified by a unique IP address, the simplest local network usually implement a router/switch with a DHCP server managing the addresses allocation: by default the Kommander‑KA unit is set to obtain a local IP address from the DHCP server. In case a DHCP server is not present on the LAN, the unit goes in AutoIP mode: in few seconds the amplifier automatically self- assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16. A static IP address can be assigned to the amplifier unit using the amplifier’s embedded web app (Network menu). The Kommander-KA02 I amplifiers can be controlled remotely by a mobile device or desktop PC/MAC.

The K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units in demanding applications. The K-framework3 operates in three modes: • 3D – Design a loudspeaker system for your venue in a full 3D environment and make free field acoustic simulations; • SETUP – import from the 3D design the active components into the workspace or build from scratch a PA system composed of active loudspeakers and amplifiers; use the input and output groups to allow full control of the system; • TUNING – Manage and control the loudspeaker system in real time: optimize the performance of the loudspeaker system during the tuning session and control its behavior in live events. The K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on-line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. The K-framework3 allows you to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available, or import from scratch in the workspace the real active loudspeakers and amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology. The network shall comprise: • single PC or MAC, running the K-framework3 software with network interface 100Mbps (or higher); • router with DHCP server 100Mbps (or higher); • Ethernet switch 100Mbps (or higher); • Cat5 (or higher) Ethernet cables. A DHCP server is highly recommended even if the device units implement the zeroconf network technologies: if a DHCP service is not available, every device will self assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16 (auto-IP). K-framework3 WINDOWS and OSX software Router/switch with DHCP server PC or MAC Kommander-KA02 I K-framework3 Sidebar Toolbar Workspace Menu bar Kommander-KA02 I User Guide 21 Grouping The working paradigm in the K-framework3 is to group the input and output channels of the amplifiers on the workspace and adjust the system performance within the groups. Groups can be created working both off-line and on-line and are retained by the real Kommander-KA units even once unplugged: if a real device belongs to a group, the group is re-created on the workspace during the synchronization process. An active loudspeaker or amplifier might belong to multiple groups sharing its features (eq filters, time delay, volume, etc). Discovery 1. Ensure that any amplifier units and the PC/Mac running the K-framework3 are properly connected to the same network. 2. Power up the Kommander-KA units. 3. Launch the K-framework3. 4. Open the Network window and launch the discovery: • If the K-framework3 finds two or more devices with the wrong ID, a dialog window appears where unique IDs can be assigned to the units. 5. Once discovered, the real units are shown in the left columns, following the order of their ID number; if the workspace contains virtual devices of the same type you can eventually modify the IDs in order to match the units and allows the synchronization. The synchronization can be in either directions: Workspace-to-Real or Real-to- Workspace. Select the sync direction and synchronize all or the single units separately A. In Setup mode, set the Kommander-KA local parameters (presets, routing, input gains, limiters, etc). B. Add INPUT and OUTPUT groups as needed. C. Assign the amplifiers units’ channels to the groups. D. Switch to Tuning mode. E. Align the system using the tools available on the groups (eq, delay, polarity, etc). The K-framework3 synchronization process reset to default the EQ, delay and volume parameters edited with the K-array Control mobile app and the embedded Web app. Kommander-KA02 I User Guide 22 Mechanical Drawing 46mm 1,8in 219mm 8,6in 170mm 6,7in 109mm 4,3in 136mm 5,4in Kommander-KA02 I User Guide 23 Specifications General Type 4ch switching mode, Class D Amplifier Output Power 1 4x 50 W @ 4 Ω Impedance minimum 4 Ω (2 Ω PBTL) Frequency Response 20 Hz – 20 kHz (±1 dB) Connectors Input: 4x BAL input: Euroblock 1.5/ 3-ST-3.81, 3.5 mm jack unBAL analog stereo AUX input, TOSLINK optical input, Output: 4x Speaker output over 2x Euroblock 2,5/ 4-G-5,08 Digital: 4x USB-A 2.0, 1x RJ45 Ethernet, Bluetooth 4.1 Low Energy, Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 b/g/n Built-in DSP Grouping, Input EQ, Output EQ, Signal Routing, Level adjustment, Dynamic Limiters, Delay Remote control Wi-Fi dedicated K-array Connect mobile app Ethernet wired K-framework3 multiplatform design and tuning software MAINS Operating Range Dedicated AC/DC power adapter 100-240V ~ AC, 50- 60 Hz input / 24 V, 4 A DC output Power Consumption 20 W @ 4 Ω load, Pink noise, 1/8 rated power Protections Over Temp.

To ensure proper operation, please carefully read the owner’s manuals and safety instruction before using the products. After reading this manual, be sure to keep it for future reference. Dante is a proprietary digital media networking solution, developed by Audinate and licensed by K-array, which allows to convey audio content over standard Ethernet networks using the Internet Protocol (Audio over IP). When a K-array device receives Dante audio packets, it reconstructs them back into a continuous digital audio stream, which is then played out. The Dante audio implementation is 100% lossless 24- or 32-bit PCM, 48 kHz sample rate. K-array devices incorporate Dante as an optional software implemented solution, giving the user to get immediate, no- fuss connectivity over IP on demand. Dante Ready Dante Ready allows the user to purchase and add audio channels to a K-array device after initial purchase with easy-to- use software, paying only for as many channels as are required. Dante Controller Dante Controller software allows the user to configure signal routes and other settings. All routes and settings are stored in the individual Dante devices, allowing them to run without any connected computers. Dante Ready Activator scans the local Dante network for any Dante Ready eligible products and shows the available options; purchases are immediately applied to the target devices for a smooth, easy experience. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, Dante Controller must be updated to version 4.5.0.9 or later (February 2022) which includes Dante Ready Activator.

Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear.

You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13972", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.680716"}, "embedding": null}

The forward-looking vision, together with continuous investments in R&D, allows Temera to provide exclusive services to the world’s major brands including optimization of logistics and production processes anti-counterfeiting, grey/parallel market’s control, from Retail dynamic up to the need to provide increasingly pervasive and loyal experiences to the customer. For their new Headquarters near Florence they asked K-array and KSCAPE to design an immersive audio and lighting experience for their their concept store. The lighting and sound design at the Temera Demo Store was devised in close relationship with the architect Marialisa Basile, Pulirian and the Temera team. THE CHALLENGE Temera was looking to reproduce an immersive user experience at their fashion store: the delicate integration of lighting and sound sources should catch the attention of the customers within a particular area of the store or even better, programmed to create a specific experience for the product the customer is targeting. There were multiple challenges for K-array and KSCAPE regarding the store designs including the shape of the building however, the most important challenge was connecting seamlessly with all the technologies within the store. Temera asked K-array to design the lighting and audio to be suitable for both live events which would be held inside the room for product launches and networking opportunities while providing flexibility to quickly change back to the luxury retail experience for client visits. THE SOLUTION Trying to satisfy all the needs that a retail space demands, RAIL, a 1.2-meter light track with integrated invisible audio is a tool that combines High-End audio and lighting in both diffuse and spot versions. Developed by K-array to meet its growing demand for unconventional audio solutions and focus on merging multiple perceptions, KSCAPE helps create new sensory experiences. Inside the demo showroom set up in Temera headquarters near Florence, which presents all the characteristics of a real physical store, K-array has installed a total of eight black RAILs, of which four are models with electrified track on which eight adjustable spotlights are connected, ideal for a retail solution, so as to focus the light on the product, and the other four are models, more elegant and minimal, of highly efficient linears. The four output channels of the smallest of K-array amplifiers, the Kommander-KA02, is able to drive all eight RAILs, a Truffle subwoofer and the diffusion of the fitting rooms with Tornado speakers, thanks to sound processing via the DSP internal to the electronics. RAIL proved to be a great help to our ambitious ideas for the new headquarters showroom. We have to always go beyond our clients expectations, it’s the nature of the world we are in and having had looked at a variety of brands and products we could not seem to find the solution that could achieve this until we were introduced to RAIL, the idea we could combine both audio at such a high level and high quality light ticked all the boxes and we were really impressed with the results, it works effortlessly with our technology.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/temera-fashion-retail-showroom", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.680740"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Are you aware of the benefits that quality sound can bring to luxury marine design? The Maiora 30 Walkaround by NEXT Yacht Group has introduced an extraordinary design concept to revolutionize all the senses for guests within this luxury boat among the impressive forms and aesthetic expressions. The Maiora 30 Walkaround has an overall length of 30.50 meters with an innovative \"walk-around\" solution for the flybridge where one single level connects the external areas of the flybridge to the bow without stairs or uncomfortable openings. It was designed for a client who was looking for a unique experience for comfort and well-being without compromising on entertainment and out of the box thinking. The Maiora 30 Walkaround, with its 30.5 meters in length, 7.5 meters in width and its inter-deck characteristics offers the owner and his guests large indoor and outdoor spaces. It owes its name to the possibility for all guests on board to walk on the flybridge - from the bow to the stern areas - in a total continuity, thanks to lateral corridors and large external surfaces, without structural impediments. Luxury is not only the value of the furniture or the comfort of the spaces, but it is the 360° experience that involves all the five senses and K-array worked together with NEXT Yacht Group to develop a complete audio system that covered each room of the boat to create the feeling of a real floating villa rather. The Maiora 30 Walkaround boasts modern interior designs with absolute minimalism, it is quite important that everything blends into the architecture, especially where entertainment is central to the room's activity, nobody wants to see a large black speaker box sticking out of the wall. But what if that sound was heard but not seen? What if the magic of professional audio just blended into the decor? Starting with the main room; home cinema, the new SAMSUNG “Luxury LED for Home Wall” system has been installed combined with ultra-flat K-array Vyper-KV25 speakers nestled into the motif of the walls, wood and mirrors, which were installed to convey the idea of spaciousness - together with Samsung's modular The Wall LED TV technology. The immersive audio experience is ideal for a high-performance DOLBY Surround sound system but also for listening to music generally as the height and distance are controlled intelligently with K-array technology for better comfort of listening for guests. Of course, the sun deck is made to enjoy the sunshine, party and dine in style which is why K-array installed Vyper-KV52 and a sub Rumble-KU212 for big sound with maximum discreteness. The Flybridge is a wonderful design feature of the boat connecting everything on one level; however, it is complicated to install speakers on the hard-top. This is en-plein-air area measures from the bow to the stern 120 square meters. K-array made full use of the loudspeakers Vyper-KV52, for discreet use in a variety of intimate environments, on this occasion installed on the walls in RAL white as the yacht. K-array’s products have now developed and refined custom finishing for Marine applications. Available in black, white and custom colors. The finishing can resist bad weather and oxidation caused by salt water and protect K-array’s premium materials like stainless steel and aluminum. The internal components are specially treated to repel water and avoid the pitting phenomenon.

{"content": "Generating Ideas Around The Kitchen With An Eye and Ear For The Future. The new showroom by Bulthaup in Toronto is an open-plan space with large plate glass windows facing the street, provides visitors with an inspiring overview of Bulthaup kitchens: islands, counters, built-in units and free-standing pieces showcase the different systems and finishes that the brand has to offer, gracefully combining white surfaces with other subtle Bulthaup hues, stainless steel, and warm wood veneers carefully crafted by their expert artisans. In addition, the showroom boasts a series of lighting fixtures by KSCAPE with the added benefit of sound, along with pieces of furniture by other manufacturers, carefully selected by principle Stefan T Sybydlo of Bulthaup — the perfect complements to the kitchens and transition areas in Bulthaup projects. All of these elements shape a renewed invitation to the pleasure of living in appealing spaces, cooking, and sharing the best moments in the heart of the home. The planning area within the showroom, located in the central hub of space, is the place where the experts at Bulthaup Toronto design and develop their projects. 2 RAIL lights with a symmetric parabolic configuration and indirect light are placed over the Workbench display controlled with DALI by a Control 4 smart system for both light and audio. The foremost value of the Bulthaup brand—the pairing of traditional craftsmanship with state-of-the-art technology—is reinforced by a team that knows their customers well and is capable of fully capturing their needs and desires, searching for the best solutions in each specific project and most importantly inspiring them. It’s exciting, having a sound come from the middle of a room so inconspicuously. It gives the consumer a new experience that fits perfectly into the modern and sleek design bulthaup clients know and love. When looking at it, it’s almost unbelievable that such great sound can come from such a thin and unassuming piece. The kitchen is the heart of the home, a space for all to congregate in and enjoy.

{"content": "Whitwam AVI has installed a K-array loudspeaker system at Canterbury Cathedral, improving intelligibility of the spoken word to levels previously unattainable. The Cathedral’s earlier sound reinforcement system, installed in the 70s, was starting to fail and was becoming intermittent. Aware that the Lambeth Conference was due to be held in the summer of 2020, the Cathedral had been in talks with AV system consultant Michael Hyland & Associates to identify their requirements for a replacement and plans were laid to upgrade to a new audio system in July, indefinitely delayed due to the COVID pandemic but eventually put out to tender. Whitwam AVI submitted a winning proposal and, together with Dave Wooster at K-array’s UK distributor 2B Heard, worked on modelling a new system for the Quire using K-Framework software. The key objective was to deliver sound more accurately at the choir stalls, since the previous speaker system was aimed horizontally out at a height of four metres and consequently the sound was flying around the building and developing multiple unwanted reflections. The solution was to deploy a number of minimally sized Tornado-KT2 speakers on custom brackets between the crenelations of the Eastery Screen, aimed downwards towards the choir stalls. A pair of Rumble-KU44 subs are mounted on custom brackets behind grilles at floor level with a further pair in amongst the stonework up towards the presbytery, lifting the bottom end of the speech vocal range. These are powered by Kommander-KA14 and KA02 amplifiers from the equipment rack located in a loft overlooking the quire. “Given that we couldn’t fix anything to the fabric of the building we had to design custom brackets for the speakers,” said Whitwam AVI director Andrew Pymm. “Fortunately the Tornados are dimensioned perfectly to fit between the crenelations with all the cabling hidden in a channel behind the wall. Their 90° conical dispersion gave us just the right coverage pattern to be able to focus at the ears of those people sitting in the choir stalls without significant overspill.\" “We had a reasonably clear run at the installation process as we were just coming out of the pandemic so as result public access to the building was limited and the worst of the supply chain issues hadn’t really hit us, and this meant that we could move pretty rapidly in getting the speakers installed and cabled up,” he commented. “We had done a trial with these speakers previously and along with the K-Framework modelling we knew what to reasonably expect, but we were pleasantly surprised at just how good the K-arrays sound in-situ. Despite a near-three second reverberation time, the spoken word is as clear as a bell and the coverage is beyond our expectations.” Gerardo Calia heads the AV support team at the Cathedral and reflected on the installation of the new K-array components: “It’s been a game changer not only in the quality and clarityof the audio, but also the aesthetic improvement brought about by incorporating modern technology into this beautiful, unique, medieval setting. I was somewhat sceptical that such small units, such discreet drivers, could supply the power required for a fairly vast space and also deliver the quality necessary for an iconic institution that hosts performances by world-renowned musicians. I need not have been concerned. The K-array system performs superbly. Whitwam and Michael Hyland have brought their extraordinary experience, their technical excellence and the very highest quality of systems integration to this wonderful building. Superb!” Whitwam’s Andrew Pymm concluded: “K-array ticked all the boxes here – I don’t know what other speaker system we could have chosen that would have the power, clarity and projection to do the job.”", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/canterbury-cathedral", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.680766"}, "embedding": null}

To ensure proper operation, please carefully read the owner’s manuals and safety instruction before using the products. After reading this manual, be sure to keep it for future reference. Dante is a proprietary digital media networking solution, developed by Audinate and licensed by K-array, which allows to convey audio content over standard Ethernet networks using the Internet Protocol (Audio over IP). When a K-array device receives Dante audio packets, it reconstructs them back into a continuous digital audio stream, which is then played out. The Dante audio implementation is 100% lossless 24- or 32-bit PCM, 48 kHz sample rate. K-array devices incorporate Dante as an optional software implemented solution, giving the user to get immediate, no- fuss connectivity over IP on demand. Dante Ready Dante Ready allows the user to purchase and add audio channels to a K-array device after initial purchase with easy-to- use software, paying only for as many channels as are required. Dante Controller Dante Controller software allows the user to configure signal routes and other settings. All routes and settings are stored in the individual Dante devices, allowing them to run without any connected computers. Dante Ready Activator scans the local Dante network for any Dante Ready eligible products and shows the available options; purchases are immediately applied to the target devices for a smooth, easy experience. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, Dante Controller must be updated to version 4.5.0.9 or later (February 2022) which includes Dante Ready Activator. Integrated Electronic Brain K-array active devices integrates a new generation intelligence software, named osKar, that allows the user to manage the entire system through various control platforms. With a real quad-core computer and embedded DSP featuring oskar, K-array devices offer enhanced signal processing and managing experience called IEB – Integrated Electronic Brain –giving the user control over the system performance. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, osKar must be updated to OS version 1.3.4 or later. K-array Dante Embedded Platforms K-array devices embedding Dante Ready born with no active Dante channels and can be upgraded to 2 IN x 2 OUT Dante channels (Ships with 0x0 / Upgradeable to 2x2).

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass.

In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13970", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.681029"}, "embedding": null}

Pinnacle is the key to providing the most prestigious theaters in the world with outstanding natural sound and extreme discretion, in fact, you cannot even see the speakers in view. The Pinnacle series does not let the speaker spoil the moment from small events to large theatres thanks to a simple modular configuration that blends into the background with ease. innovative even coverage built as one easy to use solution for multiple applications. The more elements you have, the wider the choice of configurations you can create. Medium - large events can be simple by putting together a large number of units to create a larger system. The Pinnacle-KR102, KR202 and KR204 Mark II are made up of Kobra columns with 2-inch transducers, the Pinnacle-KR402 and KR404 Mark II are the result of more combinations of 3.15-inch Python and finally the Pinnacles-KR802 and KR804 Mark II consist of Kayman columns with 4-inch transducers. All three models are made up of Thunder subwoofers, in their different variants (KS1 / KS1P, KS2 / KS2P, KS3 / KS3P, KS4 / KS4P). CALM AND COMPOSED, COME RAIN OR SHINE Built For Heavy Touring On The Road With a particular focus on audio technicians and rentals, the amplifier of the Pinnacle features a PowerCon True connector for powering the mains, allowing easier wiring extension and greater resistance to bad weather. To add that extra bit of safety, the entire connector panel is housed in a new area completely recessed inside the sub chassis, making it a practical self-shelter solution, already sufficient for lighter heavy rains. Pinnacle mark II ARE YOU A RENTAL? The more elements you have, the wider the choice of configurations you can create: by aggregating a vast number of units in a complex medium to large system; This is possible by breaking down a large system into many individual parts, one complements the other simultaneously making it also easy to manage smaller events. In addition to the number of diffusers, each system can be composed of three different types of column elements revealing the incredible scalability of Pinnacle. LEAVE YOUR BIG SYSTEMS AT HOME Pinnacle’s design isn’t simply our interpretation of what a pro audio system can be but what it should be thanks to K-array’s unique “Pure Array Technology” (PAT). This is how you can achieve maximum homogeneity of diffusion to reach everyone in the room without compromising the sound quality for the listeners. That means everyone from the front to the back of the venue and almost zero rigging efforts saving time and money. Find out more about PAT technology by watching the online webinar. EXTREME DISCRETION Camouflaged between the intricate architecture of a prestigious theater such as the moldings of the proscenium of a prestigious theater such as the Teatro alla Scala (Milan) or the Royal Opera House (London), the powerful sound reproduced by Pinnacle is extremely natural thanks to Pure Array Technology (PAT), and reaches the spectator in a harmonious way, as a creative extension of the performers on stage. The theater is just one of many applications where Pinnacle can improve the sound field for a better experience. 8 9 ACTIVE SUBWOOFER Power OUT PowerconTrue Audio OUT Analog or AES3 Audio OUT Analog Audio IN Analog or AES3 Audio IN Analog Intelligence Player, BT, Wifi, Ethernet Other options will be available in the future (Dante, AVB) Power IN PowerconTrue Speaker OUT A/B MID-HIGH and Internal SUB Speaker OUT A/B MID-HIGH and Internal SUB Speaker OUT D/C The other side or whatever you want Speaker OUT D/C The other side or whatever you want PASSIVE SUBWOOFER INPUT TERMINALS SELECTION AND LINK WIRING Internal transducer Speakon 1 1+ 1+ 1- 1- 2- 2- 2+ 2+ Speakon 2 Switch Ch. 1 2 Pinnacle mark II FULL POWER, NO COMPROMISE A harmonious ambience created by Pinnacle’s intelligent internal configuration Built with powerful class D amplifiers fully managed by sophisticated integrated DSP processors, the electronics allow the combination of Pinnacle to deliver a power signal to the subwoofer itself and offers up to three additional channels of amplification, processing giving you complete control to drive an entire stereo system using only one active unit. 10 11 STAY IN COMPLETE CONTROL A Perfect Blend of Technology To Extend The Possibilities K-frameworks3 Mac or PC Mobile APP Web APP A new generation of audio intelligence (osKar) allows you to manage the entire ecosystem through various control platforms and offers features directly on board the device, in order to simplify its use, and extend the possibilities.

Integrated Electronic Brain STUNNING TO LOOK AT, PLEASING TO THE EAR, CHOSEN FOR RELIABILITY. “One of the most compact systems ever produced, with its elegant and discreet design.” Alex Tatini - CEO The material used for the construction of the K-array speakers is certainly a distinctive element that makes the K-array products unique, contributing both to the reduction of dimensions and to durability even in unfavorable weather conditions. Line array elements such as Kobra, Python and Kayman are in fact built with a partly handcrafted process of stainless steel sheet, skilfully cut, folded and welded with the utmost care. There is a long research project behind it, to minimize vibrations and unwanted resonances of the material. For the Kobra, Python and Kayman versions, the metal also has the possibility of being subjected to galvanic treatments for a more luxurious finishes such as 24k gold plating, or a processing of the raw material such as brushing or polishing. mirror that makes the product look camouflaged on the surface where it is located. The polishing in fact allows the product to be discreet, thanks to the play of reflection, of the same texture of which the background is composed.

To ensure proper operation, please carefully read the owner’s manuals and safety instruction before using the products. After reading this manual, be sure to keep it for future reference. Dante is a proprietary digital media networking solution, developed by Audinate and licensed by K-array, which allows to convey audio content over standard Ethernet networks using the Internet Protocol (Audio over IP). When a K-array device receives Dante audio packets, it reconstructs them back into a continuous digital audio stream, which is then played out. The Dante audio implementation is 100% lossless 24- or 32-bit PCM, 48 kHz sample rate. K-array devices incorporate Dante as an optional software implemented solution, giving the user to get immediate, no- fuss connectivity over IP on demand. Dante Ready Dante Ready allows the user to purchase and add audio channels to a K-array device after initial purchase with easy-to- use software, paying only for as many channels as are required. Dante Controller Dante Controller software allows the user to configure signal routes and other settings. All routes and settings are stored in the individual Dante devices, allowing them to run without any connected computers. Dante Ready Activator scans the local Dante network for any Dante Ready eligible products and shows the available options; purchases are immediately applied to the target devices for a smooth, easy experience. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, Dante Controller must be updated to version 4.5.0.9 or later (February 2022) which includes Dante Ready Activator. Integrated Electronic Brain K-array active devices integrates a new generation intelligence software, named osKar, that allows the user to manage the entire system through various control platforms. With a real quad-core computer and embedded DSP featuring oskar, K-array devices offer enhanced signal processing and managing experience called IEB – Integrated Electronic Brain –giving the user control over the system performance. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, osKar must be updated to OS version 1.3.4 or later.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13969", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.681336"}, "embedding": null}

Integrated Electronic Brain STUNNING TO LOOK AT, PLEASING TO THE EAR, CHOSEN FOR RELIABILITY. “One of the most compact systems ever produced, with its elegant and discreet design.” Alex Tatini - CEO The material used for the construction of the K-array speakers is certainly a distinctive element that makes the K-array products unique, contributing both to the reduction of dimensions and to durability even in unfavorable weather conditions. Line array elements such as Kobra, Python and Kayman are in fact built with a partly handcrafted process of stainless steel sheet, skilfully cut, folded and welded with the utmost care. There is a long research project behind it, to minimize vibrations and unwanted resonances of the material. For the Kobra, Python and Kayman versions, the metal also has the possibility of being subjected to galvanic treatments for a more luxurious finishes such as 24k gold plating, or a processing of the raw material such as brushing or polishing. mirror that makes the product look camouflaged on the surface where it is located. The polishing in fact allows the product to be discreet, thanks to the play of reflection, of the same texture of which the background is composed.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13968", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.681628"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "1 Pinnacle mark II SYSTEMS CONFIGURATIONS Pinnacle mark II THE POWER OF ONE INNOVATIVE, PURE, EVEN SOUND A professional, versatile, audio diffusion system capable of blending in but standing out with exceptional high performance and “FITS PERFECTLY” Is An Understatement This is an audio system shaped for performance, capable of adapting to any space and hiding from sight. Pinnacle is the key to providing the most prestigious theaters in the world thanks to its extreme discretion which manifests itself both from an aesthetic / visual point of view and in terms of sound quality which is never artificial or altered. The Pinnacle series does not let the speaker spoil the moment from small events to large theatres thanks to a simple modular configuration that blends into background with ease. innovative even coverage built as one easy to use solution for multiple applications. The more elements you have, the wider the choice of configurations you can create: by aggregating a large number of units in a more complex large system, medium-large events can be semple. The Pinnacle-KR2 (Link) are made up of Kobra columns with 2-inch transducers, the Pinnacle-KR4 (Link) are the result of more combinations of 3.15-inch Python and finally the Pinnacles-KR8 consist of Kayman columns with 4-inch transducers. All three models are made up of Thunder subwoofers (link to the Thunder family page), in their different variants (KS1, KS2, KS3, KS4, KS5). LEAVE YOUR BIG SYSTEMS AT HOME Pinnacle’s design isn’t simply our interpretation of what a pro audio system can be but what it should be thanks to K-array’s unique “Pure Array Technology” (PAT), which is the maximum homogeneity of diffusion that can reach everyone in the room without compromising the sound quality for the listener from the front of the event all the way to the back. Camouflaged within the architecture of the prestigious theaters such as the Teatro alla Scala (Milan) or the Royal Opera House (London), the powerful sound reproduced by Pinnacle is extremely natural thanks to the Pure Array Technology (PAT) and reaches the spectator in harmonious way, as a creative extension of the performers on stage. Technology acts as an intermediary. Shaking our emotional experience, without tryinng to change it, respecting artists and spectators. Theaters are just one of Pinnacle’s many fields of application that make it a very useful solution wherever you need a powerful and quality sound, without using a lot of logistical and rigging efforts. A SERIOUS TIME SAVER LIGHTWEIGHT DESIGN FOR EFFORTLESS MOUNTING For the technicians who need more time, the Pinnacle introduces a new self-centering system for incredible stability to mount up to 8 Pinnacle units with just 1 person in a few minutes. The material used to build K-array audio solutions are certainly a distinctive element that makes the speakers unique, contributing both to the reduction of size and to enhanced durability even in unfavorable weather conditions. Line array elements such as Kobra, Python and Kayman are in fact built with a partly handcrafted process of stainless steel sheet, skilfully cut, folded and welded with the utmost care following years of trail and error, research and know-how to perfect the craft of minimizing vibrations along with unwanted resonances of the material. The metal can also be treated for a more luxurious finish such as 24k gold plating STUNNING TO LOOK AT. PLEASING TO THE EAR AND CHOSEN FOR BOTH DURABILITY AND INVISIBILITY. One of the most compact systems ever produced, with its elegant and discreet design. Pinnacle gives you more time to set up and tune thanks to its effortless mount and dismount system that is lightweight, compact and made easy to control. or a processing of the raw material such as brushing or polishing. mirror that makes the product particularly camouflaged on the surface where it is located. The polishing in fact allows the product to blend in perfectly, thanks to the play of reflection, of the same texture of which the background is composed The bespoke stainless steel chassis with a unique aluminium grill are certainly distinctive elements that make Pinnacle not only stand out, they provide plenty of benefits for a greater performance. Inherently strong and safe. The Pinnacle series is handmade in Italy at the K-array factory in Tuscany. FULL POWER, NO COMPROMISE A harmonious ambience created by Pinnacle’s intelligent internal configuration Built with powerful class D amplifiers fully managed by sophisticated integrated DSP processors, the electronics allow the combination of Pinnacle to deliver not only the power signal to the subwoofer itself, but offers up to three additional channels of amplification and processing, thus becoming a complete control unit that allows you to drive an entire stereo system using only one active unit. Pinnacle mark II STAY IN COMPLETE CONTROL A Perfect Blend of Technology To Extend The Possibilities CALM AND COMPOSED, COME RAIN OR SHINE Built For Heavy Touring On The Road A new generation of audio intelligence (osKar) allows you to manage the entire ecosystem through various control platforms and offers features directly on board the device, in order to simplify its use, and extend the possibilities. The osKar operating system offers the possibility to control the main functions of the DSP to manage Volumes, Routing and Presets directly from the device itself, it also has a USB player and a web stream receiver. With a particular focus on audio technicians and rentals, the amplifier of the Pinnacle features a PowerCon True connector for powering the mains, allowing easier wiring extension and greater resistance to bad weather. The remote control of subwoofers can take place through three different types of software released, starting from the most complete K-framework for Windows and Mac, passing from a more intuitive web app and arriving at the more simplified mobile app (wi- fi). There are also APIs and plugins to control these devices via third-party controllers. An LED located on the front of each machine allows the user to understand which device he has entered into communication with. To add that extra bit of safety, the entire connector panel is housed in a new area completely recessed inside the sub chassis, making it a practical self-shelter solution, already sufficient for lighter heavy rains. ARE YOU A RENTAL? The more elements you have, the wider the choice of configurations you can create: by aggregating a vast number of units in a complex medium to large system; This is possible by breaking down a large system into many individual parts, one complements the other simultaneously making it also easy to manage smaller events. In addition to the number of diffusers, each system can be composed of three different types of column elements revealing the incredible scalability of Pinnacle. Here lies the scalability of Pinnacle: The Pinnacle-KR2 (Link) are made up of Kobra columns with 2-inch transducers, the Pinnacle-KR4 are the result of more combinations of 3.15-inch Python and finally the Pinnacles-KR8 consist of Kayman columns with 4-inch transducers. All three models are made up of Thunder subwoofers (link to the Thunder family page), in their different variants (KS1, KS2, KS3, KS4, KS5). Pinnacle mark II EXTREME DISCRETION Surely among the most compact high-performance systems ever produced, with its elegant and discreet shapes, Pinnacle is the key to access the most prestigious theaters in the world thanks to its extreme discretion which manifests itself both from an aesthetic / visual point of view and in terms of sound quality which is never artificial or altered. Pinnacle represents more than any other K-array product, the pure essence of professional audio, which does not need to seen. Camouflaged between the intricate architecture of a prestigious theater such as the moldings of the proscenium of a prestigious theater such as the NO MORE COMPROMISE A fundamental characteristic of PAT Technology (Pure Array Technology) on which the design of Pinnacle systems is based, is the maximum homogeneity of diffusion for very large audiences. Those who sit near the stage and those who attend from the back rows can enjoy the same sound experience as the ones with the best seats in the house. It also applies to those who look out from the typical boxes of an Italian-style theater. PAT technology creates an unrivaled sound distribution thanks to the length of the arrays it can generate especially with the Pinnacle system. An array that extends over the entire height of the proscenium will ensure a very homogeneous listening experience both at the various heights from which the stages overlook, reaching even the most distant with almost the same sound pressure. This occurs due to an addition or subtraction of the energetic component of all the transducers of the sound line that will reach the different listening points more or less in phase: at longer distances the number of sound waves emitted by the different transducers of the array will be greater. Thank to phasing at that point and this will make it possible to perceive as closer even a sound emitted from so far away. Teatro alla Scala (Milan) or the Royal Opera House (London), the powerful sound reproduced by Pinnacle is extremely natural thanks to Pure Array Technology (PAT), and reaches the spectator in a harmonious way, as a creative extension of the performers on stage. The theater is just one of many applications where Pinnacle can improve the sound field for a better experience. CRAFTED TO LAST The material used for the construction of the K-array speakers is certainly a distinctive element that makes the K-array products unique, contributing both to the reduction of dimensions and to durability even in unfavorable weather conditions. Line array elements such as Kobra, Python and Kayman are in fact built with a partly handcrafted process of stainless steel sheet, skilfully cut, folded and welded with the utmost care. There is a long research project behind it, to minimize vibrations and unwanted resonances of the material. For the Kobra, Python and Kayman versions, the metal also has the possibility of being subjected to galvanic treatments for a more luxurious finishes such as 24k gold plating, or a processing of the raw material such as brushing or polishing. mirror that makes the product look camouflaged on the surface where it is located. The polishing in fact allows the product to be discreet, thanks to the play of reflection, of the same texture of which the background is composed.

Both versions offer multichannel free routing and DSP with features such as grouping, input and output equalizers, level adjustment, dynamic limiters, and 4-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA14 I 4 4 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA34 4 4 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA104 4 4 2500W @ 4Ω 8-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA18 8 8 150W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA28 8 8 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA68 8 8 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA208 8 8 2500W @ 4Ω delay per channel. The key difference between IEB and IEB-pro is the expanded networking capabilities of the IEB-pro. These networking features are compatible with various professional audio protocols for managing digital audio streams, ensuring seamless integration with existing technologies and providing an optimal experience for integrators and system engineers. Network Types and Audio Protocols Standard IEB (Integrated Electronic Brain) The standard IEB includes one network port with fast Ethernet connection (1 Gigabit / 1.000 Mbps) and standard Wi-Fi with an internal access point. Wi-Fi connection can be extended through a router and amplifiers connected in Wi-Fi Client Mode. The physical network connection allows remote control via Ethernet and enables the following physical network topologies: • Standard Star Topology - (Control only - Wi-Fi switched off) • Standard Star topology - Control and DANTE network (primary network without redundancy - Wi-Fi switched off). With a single wired Ethernet connection, both control and audio streams are integrated into the same network flow. IEB-Pro The IEB-Pro is equipped with a 2-port network switch featuring Ethernet connections (1 Gigabit / 1000 Mbps), but does not include Wi-Fi capability. The supported network topologies are as follows: • Star Network Topology - Control only - amplifiers in single- port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante sharing the same network (amplifiers in single-port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante Redundancy (amplifiers in single port mode - redundancy requires two fully separated networks); • Star Network Topology - with Control and Dante Splitted( amplifiers in single-port mode) - split requires two fully separated networks; • Daisy Chain Network with Control (amplifiers set in bridge- mode) - not recommended for DanteTM. For more information on Dante network topologies and primary/ secondary port configurations, please refer to the dedicated chapter on DANTE network.

Since every host on a network must be identified by a unique IP address, the simplest local network usually implements a router/switch with a DHCP server managing the addresses allocation: by default the Kommander‑KA unit is set to obtain a local IP address from the DHCP server. In case a DHCP server is not present on the LAN, the unit goes in Auto IP mode: in few seconds the amplifier automatically self- assigns an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16. A static IP address can be assigned to the amplifier unit using the amplifier’s embedded web app (Network menu). It is possible to connect to the amplifiers wired to the switch via a Wi-Fi access point and configure them using the K-Connect app on a mobile device. Please ensure that the access point is connected to the same local network (LAN) as the switch to allow communication between all devices. When amplifiers are connected to the network via Ethrnet cables, it is recommended to disable the amplifiers built-in Wi-Fi hot- spot.

Kommander-KA User Guide 20 Network topology and network requirements Single Network - Star Topology Control + Digital Audio Streaming A star network configuration for single network amplifiers allows both remote control and digital audio streaming to run over the same network, providing centralized management and high-quality audio distribution. This setup ensures reliable performance and optimal bandwidth allocation for complex audio systems. A. First connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration and using ETH1 port. B. The same network configuration is used to control the amplifiers and utilize the Digital Audio Stream simultaneously. Single Network - Daisy Chain Control ONLY Daisy chaining network amplifiers allows multiple devices to be connected in daisy chain using a single network cable, streamlining installation and minimizing the need for additional switches. This configuration is ideal for remote control of amplifiers in multi-zone systems; however, it is not recommended for transmitting digital audio streams, as it may restrict bandwidth and degrade signal quality. Connecting the First Amplifier: 3. Connect the EHT1 port of the first amplifier to an external switch or network source. 4. Set the first amplifier to bridge mode. 5. Connect the EHT2 port of the first amplifier to the EHT1 port of the second amplifier. 6. Continue this pattern, connecting the EHT2 port of each amplifier to the EHT1 port of the next amplifier. Kommander-KA+ The Kommander-KA+ are equipped with the IEB-Pro platform, which, as we have seen, includes a switch with 2 ports for Ethernet-wired connections but does not have built-in Wi-Fi. Therefore, the primary access and control methods must be through a local network connected with Ethernet cables to a dedicated switch. • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel. The managing control softwares are the embedded Web- app, K-monitor or K-framework. Network settings (with DanteTM) • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel • disable the ENABLE AUTOIP function in the network tab. • Avoid Daisy-Chain if working with DanteTM. (Audinate, the manufacturer, does not recommend daisy-chaining through more than two hops, as this can cause latency issues and potentially disrupt the audio stream.) See the DanteReadyTM paragraph to more details. Built-in Wi-Fi is not present on KA+ - direct Wi-Fi connection is not possible - connection via an access point on the same LAN is supported for K-Connect use.

The system also K-framework3 WINDOWS and OSX software Sidebar Toolbar Workspace Menu bar Kommander-KA User Guide 35 • TUNING – Manage and control the loudspeaker system in real time: optimize the performance of the loudspeaker system during the tuning session and control its behavior in live events. K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on- line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. K-framework3 allows to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available, or import from scratch in the workspace the real active loudspeakers and amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology.* The network shall comprise of: • single PC or MAC, running the K-framework3 software with network interface 100Mbps (or higher); • router with DHCP server 100Mbps (or higher); • Ethernet switch 100Mbps (or higher); • Cat5 (or higher) Ethernet cables. A DHCP server is highly recommended even if the device units implement the zeroconf network technologies: if a DHCP service is not available, every device will self assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16 (auto-IP). Discovery 1. Ensure that all the units and the PC/Mac running the K-framework3 are properly connected to the same network. 2. Power up the units. 3. Launch K-framework3. 4. Open the Network window and launch the discovery: • If K-framework3 finds two or more devices with the wrong ID, a dialog window appears where unique IDs can be assigned to the units. 5. Once discovered, the real units are shown in the left columns, following the order of their ID number; if the workspace contains virtual devices of the same type you can eventually modify the IDs in order to match the units and allows the synchronization. The synchronization can be in either directions: Workspace-to-Real or Real-to- Workspace. Select the sync direction and synchronize all or the single units separately 3D simulation In the 3D simulation mode of K-Framework 3, you can position systems and speakers at precise height and distance coordinates. The system then calculates sound emission and simulates sound pressure levels based on these coordinates and the defined dimensions of the listening area, allowing for accurate configuration and adjustment.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13966", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.681958"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "The Challenge To build the next generation of offices, JLL wanted to optimize every aspect of their new 23,592 sq ft space to create a groundbreaking human centric workplace. One of those areas was sound. The sound of workplaces is intrinsically linked to employees’ quality of life and yet it is typically the top complaint in offices. The sound of most workplaces is distracting and stressful, and impacts employee wellbeing. In addition lighting is an essential component to wellbeing within the workplace, not only do they require a light capable of delivering a comfortable performance but also to work with their Crestron ecosystem and create a human centric design to follow the light of the day especially as they have large windows overlooking the city. The Solution KSCAPE along with Moodsonic were chosen by JLL’s design team to improve the quality of employees’ experiences using sound. Moodsonic are pioneers in delivering soundscapes that bring the therapeutic benefits of natural sound indoors. Moodsonic’s content is designed for a range of purposes, from focussed soundscapes that improve attention and restoration, through to content for collaboration, comfort or creativity. JLL’s Capita Springs office was awarded with WELL Platinum certification. “The RAILs play soundscapes that are generated algorithmically by a Moodsonic device connected to a matrix through 1 x K-array KA18 amplifier with 12 RAIL connected to each of the 8 x 150w channels for audio.” Thomas Riby KSCAPE Brand Manager Dynamic Soundscapes Moodsonic creates a range of sensory experiences across JLL’s office to cater to different personalities and activities, delivered with RAIL’s unique technology. The soundscapes are rooted in science and generated in real-time using algorithms. Because of this, they can respond to real-time changing environmental conditions in JLL’s workplace. Research shows that the positive impacts of biophilic design are enhanced when the senses are aligned. So, by delivering complementary nature-based soundscapes into their workplace, JLL can also enhance the impact of its existing visual design and biophilia. Meeting Rooms JLL installed RAIL in six of their meeting rooms. Small meeting rooms were included 2x RAIL units connected seamlessly together while the larger rooms used 4x symmetric linear. Every room had RAIL suspended from the ceiling underneath a Shure beam steering microphone. The audio was powered by 1 Kommander-KA02 amplifier and 1 Rumble-KU44 subwoofer for optimised speech performance without noticing there are speakers in the room. “What we have built in CapitaSpring is the next generation office space” Chris Archibold Country Manager, JLL Singapore With RAIL we were able to solve a number of challenges in one product. It worked very well with the beam steering microphone and the system can be configured to account for a standing or seated audience. This was perfect for us because we did not want to make meetings any more complicated for users and reduce the clutter of technology that you see in many spaces. It also saved on wiring, installing and drafting", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/jll-workplace-design-using-kscape", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.682005"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "It’s an age-old problem for hospitality operators: some of the most beautiful venues with the grandest features, highest ceilings and breathtaking architecture are venerable, often unsuited to the demands of modern hospitality and heritage listed. If you had to find a space that exemplifies this best, then look no further than Reine & La Rue. Reine & La Rue is part of the Nomad Hospitality Group run by husband and wife team Rebecca and Al Yazbek. Rebecca has an architectural background and admits to catching the bug when first shown the space on Collins Street, Melbourne. “It was actually the site of the first stock exchange, built in 1887. When the agent showed us the space it hadn’t been occupied for some time and was a demolition site.” Thankfully the landlord, property developer GPT, would restore the building and it had approvals to be a restaurant. “But that was only the first step,” notes Rebecca. “We had to work through Heritage Victoria approvals, City of Melbourne, approvals, feedback from Melburnians who love this space... all of that was hard and time consuming – it took years and years to work through.” When approached by Arup and the Nomad Hospitality Group, we recognized the unique hurdles posed by the grandeur of the Reine & La Rue venue. With stratospheric ceilings and a heritage listing that demanded utmost respect for the original structure, traditional audio solutions seemed impractical. However, our team embraced the opportunity to innovate and deliver a solution that exceeded expectations. The first step was understanding the acoustic complexities of the space. Working closely with Arup's talented consultants, we utilized advanced modeling techniques to analyze the room's reverberation characteristics. The result? A comprehensive strategy to tame the rampant reverberation while preserving the venue's architectural integrity. Our Lyzard loudspeakers emerged as the perfect solution for delivering high-fidelity sound in a discreet and unobtrusive manner. Unlike traditional speakers, Lyzards offered unparalleled flexibility in placement, allowing us to integrate them seamlessly into the venue's joinery insertions. This innovative approach not only met the stringent requirements of the heritage listing but also provided patrons with an immersive audio experience like no other. Collaborating with Insight Systems for system integration and installation, we ensured that every aspect of the audio solution was meticulously executed. The result speaks for itself – patrons of Reine & La Rue are captivated by the immersive sound experience, often unable to discern the source of the music. As pioneers in audio technology, we take pride in the success of projects like Reine & La Rue. It's a testament to our dedication to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in audio reproduction, even in the most challenging of environments. At K-array, we don't just provide audio solutions – we create unforgettable experiences that resonate with audiences for years to come.

{"content": "USER GUIDE •20230515• Dante Ready implementation on K-array devices Activating Dante Ready KA18 KA28 KA68 KA208 KA14 KA34 KA104 Integrated Electronic Brain Activating Dante Ready User Guide 2 Thank you for choosing this K-array products! To ensure proper operation, please carefully read the owner’s manuals and safety instruction before using the products. After reading this manual, be sure to keep it for future reference. Dante is a proprietary digital media networking solution, developed by Audinate and licensed by K-array, which allows to convey audio content over standard Ethernet networks using the Internet Protocol (Audio over IP). When a K-array device receives Dante audio packets, it reconstructs them back into a continuous digital audio stream, which is then played out. The Dante audio implementation is 100% lossless 24- or 32-bit PCM, 48 kHz sample rate. K-array devices incorporate Dante as an optional software implemented solution, giving the user to get immediate, no- fuss connectivity over IP on demand. Dante Ready Dante Ready allows the user to purchase and add audio channels to a K-array device after initial purchase with easy-to- use software, paying only for as many channels as are required. Dante Controller Dante Controller software allows the user to configure signal routes and other settings. All routes and settings are stored in the individual Dante devices, allowing them to run without any connected computers. Dante Ready Activator scans the local Dante network for any Dante Ready eligible products and shows the available options; purchases are immediately applied to the target devices for a smooth, easy experience. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, Dante Controller must be updated to version 4.5.0.9 or later (February 2022) which includes Dante Ready Activator. Integrated Electronic Brain K-array active devices integrates a new generation intelligence software, named osKar, that allows the user to manage the entire system through various control platforms. With a real quad-core computer and embedded DSP featuring oskar, K-array devices offer enhanced signal processing and managing experience called IEB – Integrated Electronic Brain –giving the user control over the system performance.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13964", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.682141"}, "embedding": null}

Integrated Electronic Brain STUNNING TO LOOK AT, PLEASING TO THE EAR, CHOSEN FOR RELIABILITY. “One of the most compact systems ever produced, with its elegant and discreet design.” Alex Tatini - CEO The material used for the construction of the K-array speakers is certainly a distinctive element that makes the K-array products unique, contributing both to the reduction of dimensions and to durability even in unfavorable weather conditions. Line array elements such as Kobra, Python and Kayman are in fact built with a partly handcrafted process of stainless steel sheet, skilfully cut, folded and welded with the utmost care. There is a long research project behind it, to minimize vibrations and unwanted resonances of the material. For the Kobra, Python and Kayman versions, the metal also has the possibility of being subjected to galvanic treatments for a more luxurious finishes such as 24k gold plating, or a processing of the raw material such as brushing or polishing. mirror that makes the product look camouflaged on the surface where it is located. The polishing in fact allows the product to be discreet, thanks to the play of reflection, of the same texture of which the background is composed.

To ensure proper operation, please carefully read the owner’s manuals and safety instruction before using the products. After reading this manual, be sure to keep it for future reference. Dante is a proprietary digital media networking solution, developed by Audinate and licensed by K-array, which allows to convey audio content over standard Ethernet networks using the Internet Protocol (Audio over IP). When a K-array device receives Dante audio packets, it reconstructs them back into a continuous digital audio stream, which is then played out. The Dante audio implementation is 100% lossless 24- or 32-bit PCM, 48 kHz sample rate. K-array devices incorporate Dante as an optional software implemented solution, giving the user to get immediate, no- fuss connectivity over IP on demand. Dante Ready Dante Ready allows the user to purchase and add audio channels to a K-array device after initial purchase with easy-to- use software, paying only for as many channels as are required. Dante Controller Dante Controller software allows the user to configure signal routes and other settings. All routes and settings are stored in the individual Dante devices, allowing them to run without any connected computers. Dante Ready Activator scans the local Dante network for any Dante Ready eligible products and shows the available options; purchases are immediately applied to the target devices for a smooth, easy experience. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, Dante Controller must be updated to version 4.5.0.9 or later (February 2022) which includes Dante Ready Activator. Integrated Electronic Brain K-array active devices integrates a new generation intelligence software, named osKar, that allows the user to manage the entire system through various control platforms. With a real quad-core computer and embedded DSP featuring oskar, K-array devices offer enhanced signal processing and managing experience called IEB – Integrated Electronic Brain –giving the user control over the system performance. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, osKar must be updated to OS version 1.3.4 or later. K-array Dante Embedded Platforms K-array devices embedding Dante Ready born with no active Dante channels and can be upgraded to 2 IN x 2 OUT Dante channels (Ships with 0x0 / Upgradeable to 2x2).

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13963", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.682409"}, "embedding": null}

The osKar operating system offers the possibility to control the main functions of the DSP to manage Volumes, Routing and Presets directly from the device itself, it also has a USB player and a web stream receiver. The remote control of subwoofers can take place through three different types of software released, starting from the most complete K-framework for Windows and Mac, passing from a more intuitive web app and arriving at the more simplified mobile app (wi- fi). There are also APIs and plugins to control these devices via third-party controllers. An LED located on the front of each machine allows the user to understand which device he has entered into communication with. POWERED BY INTELLIGENCE Enhanced performance and easy tuning are now managed by the Integrated Electronic Brain - IEB - implemented into K-array amplifiers. More than a traditional DSP, the built-in micro electronics driven by the integrated operating system osKar features expansive sound processing, offering complete user control over the system performance osKar Operative System Volumes, Signal Routing, Presets as well as a complete USB player, are directly manageable through three different types of software and dedicated professional interface. Integrated Electronic Brain STUNNING TO LOOK AT, PLEASING TO THE EAR, CHOSEN FOR RELIABILITY. “One of the most compact systems ever produced, with its elegant and discreet design.” Alex Tatini - CEO The material used for the construction of the K-array speakers is certainly a distinctive element that makes the K-array products unique, contributing both to the reduction of dimensions and to durability even in unfavorable weather conditions. Line array elements such as Kobra, Python and Kayman are in fact built with a partly handcrafted process of stainless steel sheet, skilfully cut, folded and welded with the utmost care. There is a long research project behind it, to minimize vibrations and unwanted resonances of the material. For the Kobra, Python and Kayman versions, the metal also has the possibility of being subjected to galvanic treatments for a more luxurious finishes such as 24k gold plating, or a processing of the raw material such as brushing or polishing. mirror that makes the product look camouflaged on the surface where it is located. The polishing in fact allows the product to be discreet, thanks to the play of reflection, of the same texture of which the background is composed.

Both versions offer multichannel free routing and DSP with features such as grouping, input and output equalizers, level adjustment, dynamic limiters, and 4-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA14 I 4 4 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA34 4 4 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA104 4 4 2500W @ 4Ω 8-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA18 8 8 150W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA28 8 8 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA68 8 8 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA208 8 8 2500W @ 4Ω delay per channel. The key difference between IEB and IEB-pro is the expanded networking capabilities of the IEB-pro. These networking features are compatible with various professional audio protocols for managing digital audio streams, ensuring seamless integration with existing technologies and providing an optimal experience for integrators and system engineers. Network Types and Audio Protocols Standard IEB (Integrated Electronic Brain) The standard IEB includes one network port with fast Ethernet connection (1 Gigabit / 1.000 Mbps) and standard Wi-Fi with an internal access point. Wi-Fi connection can be extended through a router and amplifiers connected in Wi-Fi Client Mode. The physical network connection allows remote control via Ethernet and enables the following physical network topologies: • Standard Star Topology - (Control only - Wi-Fi switched off) • Standard Star topology - Control and DANTE network (primary network without redundancy - Wi-Fi switched off). With a single wired Ethernet connection, both control and audio streams are integrated into the same network flow. IEB-Pro The IEB-Pro is equipped with a 2-port network switch featuring Ethernet connections (1 Gigabit / 1000 Mbps), but does not include Wi-Fi capability. The supported network topologies are as follows: • Star Network Topology - Control only - amplifiers in single- port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante sharing the same network (amplifiers in single-port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante Redundancy (amplifiers in single port mode - redundancy requires two fully separated networks); • Star Network Topology - with Control and Dante Splitted( amplifiers in single-port mode) - split requires two fully separated networks; • Daisy Chain Network with Control (amplifiers set in bridge- mode) - not recommended for DanteTM. For more information on Dante network topologies and primary/ secondary port configurations, please refer to the dedicated chapter on DANTE network.

Since every host on a network must be identified by a unique IP address, the simplest local network usually implements a router/switch with a DHCP server managing the addresses allocation: by default the Kommander‑KA unit is set to obtain a local IP address from the DHCP server. In case a DHCP server is not present on the LAN, the unit goes in Auto IP mode: in few seconds the amplifier automatically self- assigns an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16. A static IP address can be assigned to the amplifier unit using the amplifier’s embedded web app (Network menu). It is possible to connect to the amplifiers wired to the switch via a Wi-Fi access point and configure them using the K-Connect app on a mobile device. Please ensure that the access point is connected to the same local network (LAN) as the switch to allow communication between all devices. When amplifiers are connected to the network via Ethrnet cables, it is recommended to disable the amplifiers built-in Wi-Fi hot- spot.

Kommander-KA User Guide 20 Network topology and network requirements Single Network - Star Topology Control + Digital Audio Streaming A star network configuration for single network amplifiers allows both remote control and digital audio streaming to run over the same network, providing centralized management and high-quality audio distribution. This setup ensures reliable performance and optimal bandwidth allocation for complex audio systems. A. First connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration and using ETH1 port. B. The same network configuration is used to control the amplifiers and utilize the Digital Audio Stream simultaneously. Single Network - Daisy Chain Control ONLY Daisy chaining network amplifiers allows multiple devices to be connected in daisy chain using a single network cable, streamlining installation and minimizing the need for additional switches. This configuration is ideal for remote control of amplifiers in multi-zone systems; however, it is not recommended for transmitting digital audio streams, as it may restrict bandwidth and degrade signal quality. Connecting the First Amplifier: 3. Connect the EHT1 port of the first amplifier to an external switch or network source. 4. Set the first amplifier to bridge mode. 5. Connect the EHT2 port of the first amplifier to the EHT1 port of the second amplifier. 6. Continue this pattern, connecting the EHT2 port of each amplifier to the EHT1 port of the next amplifier. Kommander-KA+ The Kommander-KA+ are equipped with the IEB-Pro platform, which, as we have seen, includes a switch with 2 ports for Ethernet-wired connections but does not have built-in Wi-Fi. Therefore, the primary access and control methods must be through a local network connected with Ethernet cables to a dedicated switch. • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel. The managing control softwares are the embedded Web- app, K-monitor or K-framework. Network settings (with DanteTM) • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel • disable the ENABLE AUTOIP function in the network tab. • Avoid Daisy-Chain if working with DanteTM. (Audinate, the manufacturer, does not recommend daisy-chaining through more than two hops, as this can cause latency issues and potentially disrupt the audio stream.) See the DanteReadyTM paragraph to more details. Built-in Wi-Fi is not present on KA+ - direct Wi-Fi connection is not possible - connection via an access point on the same LAN is supported for K-Connect use.

CONTROL ONLY BRIDGE MODE A - B C - D Kommander-KA USER GUIDE 22 Dual-Network Configuration Primary / Secondary In a dual network configuration, both control signals and digital audio streaming are transmitted over the primary wired network, ensuring centralized management and efficient use of bandwidth. By connecting the second network port of the amplifiers to a separate switch, a secondary or redundant network can be established, dedicated solely to the Dante™ audio streaming or other audio-over-IP protocols. This setup enhances system reliability and ensures uninterrupted audio performance. G. Connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration using ETH1 port. H.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13962", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.682691"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "USER GUIDE •20230515• Dante Ready implementation on K-array devices Activating Dante Ready KA18 KA28 KA68 KA208 KA14 KA34 KA104 Integrated Electronic Brain Activating Dante Ready User Guide 2 Thank you for choosing this K-array products! To ensure proper operation, please carefully read the owner’s manuals and safety instruction before using the products. After reading this manual, be sure to keep it for future reference. Dante is a proprietary digital media networking solution, developed by Audinate and licensed by K-array, which allows to convey audio content over standard Ethernet networks using the Internet Protocol (Audio over IP). When a K-array device receives Dante audio packets, it reconstructs them back into a continuous digital audio stream, which is then played out. The Dante audio implementation is 100% lossless 24- or 32-bit PCM, 48 kHz sample rate. K-array devices incorporate Dante as an optional software implemented solution, giving the user to get immediate, no- fuss connectivity over IP on demand. Dante Ready Dante Ready allows the user to purchase and add audio channels to a K-array device after initial purchase with easy-to- use software, paying only for as many channels as are required. Dante Controller Dante Controller software allows the user to configure signal routes and other settings. All routes and settings are stored in the individual Dante devices, allowing them to run without any connected computers. Dante Ready Activator scans the local Dante network for any Dante Ready eligible products and shows the available options; purchases are immediately applied to the target devices for a smooth, easy experience. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, Dante Controller must be updated to version 4.5.0.9 or later (February 2022) which includes Dante Ready Activator. Integrated Electronic Brain K-array active devices integrates a new generation intelligence software, named osKar, that allows the user to manage the entire system through various control platforms. With a real quad-core computer and embedded DSP featuring oskar, K-array devices offer enhanced signal processing and managing experience called IEB – Integrated Electronic Brain –giving the user control over the system performance. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, osKar must be updated to OS version 1.3.4 or later. K-array Dante Embedded Platforms K-array devices embedding Dante Ready born with no active Dante channels and can be upgraded to 2 IN x 2 OUT Dante channels (Ships with 0x0 / Upgradeable to 2x2). Customers can make channel purchases directly within Dante Controller using Audinate’s payment system on the following K-array devices and systems: • Mugello-KH2 I • Mugello-KH3 I • Mugello-KH5 I • Thunder-KS1 I • Thunder-KS2 I • Thunder-KS3 I • Thunder-KS4 I • Thunder-KS5 I • Kommander-KA02 I • Kommander-KA04 • Kommander-KA14 I • Kommander-KA18 • Kommander-KA28 • Kommander-KA34 • Kommander-KA68 • Kommander-KA104 • Kommander-KA208 • Azimut-KAMUT2L II • Azimut-KAMU2L1 II • Azimut-KAMUT2L14 II • AzimutKAMUT2V25 II • Pinnacle-KR102 II • Pinnacle-KR202 II • Pinnacle-KR204 II • Pinnacle-KR402 II • Pinnacle-KR404 II • Pinnacle-KR802 II • Pinnacle-KR804 II Activating Dante Ready User Guide Add Dante Channels To A K-array Device 1.

The key difference between IEB and IEB-pro is the expanded networking capabilities of the IEB-pro. These networking features are compatible with various professional audio protocols for managing digital audio streams, ensuring seamless integration with existing technologies and providing an optimal experience for integrators and system engineers. Network Types and Audio Protocols Standard IEB (Integrated Electronic Brain) The standard IEB includes one network port with fast Ethernet connection (1 Gigabit / 1.000 Mbps) and standard Wi-Fi with an internal access point. Wi-Fi connection can be extended through a router and amplifiers connected in Wi-Fi Client Mode. The physical network connection allows remote control via Ethernet and enables the following physical network topologies: • Standard Star Topology - (Control only - Wi-Fi switched off) • Standard Star topology - Control and DANTE network (primary network without redundancy - Wi-Fi switched off). With a single wired Ethernet connection, both control and audio streams are integrated into the same network flow. IEB-Pro The IEB-Pro is equipped with a 2-port network switch featuring Ethernet connections (1 Gigabit / 1000 Mbps), but does not include Wi-Fi capability. The supported network topologies are as follows: • Star Network Topology - Control only - amplifiers in single- port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante sharing the same network (amplifiers in single-port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante Redundancy (amplifiers in single port mode - redundancy requires two fully separated networks); • Star Network Topology - with Control and Dante Splitted( amplifiers in single-port mode) - split requires two fully separated networks; • Daisy Chain Network with Control (amplifiers set in bridge- mode) - not recommended for DanteTM. For more information on Dante network topologies and primary/ secondary port configurations, please refer to the dedicated chapter on DANTE network.

Since every host on a network must be identified by a unique IP address, the simplest local network usually implements a router/switch with a DHCP server managing the addresses allocation: by default the Kommander‑KA unit is set to obtain a local IP address from the DHCP server. In case a DHCP server is not present on the LAN, the unit goes in Auto IP mode: in few seconds the amplifier automatically self- assigns an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16. A static IP address can be assigned to the amplifier unit using the amplifier’s embedded web app (Network menu). It is possible to connect to the amplifiers wired to the switch via a Wi-Fi access point and configure them using the K-Connect app on a mobile device. Please ensure that the access point is connected to the same local network (LAN) as the switch to allow communication between all devices. When amplifiers are connected to the network via Ethrnet cables, it is recommended to disable the amplifiers built-in Wi-Fi hot- spot.

Kommander-KA User Guide 20 Network topology and network requirements Single Network - Star Topology Control + Digital Audio Streaming A star network configuration for single network amplifiers allows both remote control and digital audio streaming to run over the same network, providing centralized management and high-quality audio distribution. This setup ensures reliable performance and optimal bandwidth allocation for complex audio systems. A. First connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration and using ETH1 port. B. The same network configuration is used to control the amplifiers and utilize the Digital Audio Stream simultaneously. Single Network - Daisy Chain Control ONLY Daisy chaining network amplifiers allows multiple devices to be connected in daisy chain using a single network cable, streamlining installation and minimizing the need for additional switches. This configuration is ideal for remote control of amplifiers in multi-zone systems; however, it is not recommended for transmitting digital audio streams, as it may restrict bandwidth and degrade signal quality. Connecting the First Amplifier: 3. Connect the EHT1 port of the first amplifier to an external switch or network source. 4. Set the first amplifier to bridge mode. 5. Connect the EHT2 port of the first amplifier to the EHT1 port of the second amplifier. 6. Continue this pattern, connecting the EHT2 port of each amplifier to the EHT1 port of the next amplifier. Kommander-KA+ The Kommander-KA+ are equipped with the IEB-Pro platform, which, as we have seen, includes a switch with 2 ports for Ethernet-wired connections but does not have built-in Wi-Fi. Therefore, the primary access and control methods must be through a local network connected with Ethernet cables to a dedicated switch. • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel. The managing control softwares are the embedded Web- app, K-monitor or K-framework. Network settings (with DanteTM) • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel • disable the ENABLE AUTOIP function in the network tab. • Avoid Daisy-Chain if working with DanteTM. (Audinate, the manufacturer, does not recommend daisy-chaining through more than two hops, as this can cause latency issues and potentially disrupt the audio stream.) See the DanteReadyTM paragraph to more details. Built-in Wi-Fi is not present on KA+ - direct Wi-Fi connection is not possible - connection via an access point on the same LAN is supported for K-Connect use.

K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on- line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. K-framework3 allows to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available, or import from scratch in the workspace the real active loudspeakers and amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology.* The network shall comprise of: • single PC or MAC, running the K-framework3 software with network interface 100Mbps (or higher); • router with DHCP server 100Mbps (or higher); • Ethernet switch 100Mbps (or higher); • Cat5 (or higher) Ethernet cables. A DHCP server is highly recommended even if the device units implement the zeroconf network technologies: if a DHCP service is not available, every device will self assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16 (auto-IP). Discovery 1. Ensure that all the units and the PC/Mac running the K-framework3 are properly connected to the same network. 2. Power up the units. 3. Launch K-framework3. 4. Open the Network window and launch the discovery: • If K-framework3 finds two or more devices with the wrong ID, a dialog window appears where unique IDs can be assigned to the units. 5. Once discovered, the real units are shown in the left columns, following the order of their ID number; if the workspace contains virtual devices of the same type you can eventually modify the IDs in order to match the units and allows the synchronization. The synchronization can be in either directions: Workspace-to-Real or Real-to- Workspace.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13960", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.682999"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "Pavion, a leading US-based integrator of fire, security and audio-visual technology solutions, recently opened its new office headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina. The goal was to establish a space for Pavion to showcase its cutting-edge technology solutions whilst providing an updated working environment for its employees. A technology-centric workspace would not only benefit the Pavion team but also allow clients to experience, first-hand, the kind of inspiring technology that they could achieve in their own companies through working with Pavion. The project was undertaken in a collaboration between Pavion and IA Architects, who worked together to design and execute a solution based on KSCAPE’s innovative RAIL technology. “When designing and developing the Pavion Raleigh office, we had three critical focuses: Our People, Our Customers and Innovation,” explains Kristina VanderBrink, Southeast Regional Sales Director at Pavion. “We believe everything starts with our people - they are the centre of our solutions. The goal was to create a workplace that promotes our team members to come into the office, nurtures collaboration and cultivates a sense of belonging. The biggest requests we received from all our team members when designing our new space were centred around the quality of the installed lighting, the workplace acoustics and providing lots of natural light. Our mission was then focused on finding the right space and the right partners to best incorporate these critical features. That was a driving factor for working with K-array and KSCAPE.” One product in particular stood out: KSCAPE’s RAIL, which would ultimately serve as the centrepiece of the integration. Offering both professional audio and tunable white and RGB lighting, the versatility of RAIL made it a clear choice for Pavion. The integrated lighting modes were ideal for the zonal spaces at Pavion. Once installed, the team would have the control, via CASAMBI, to seamlessly adjust the lighting and therefore the atmosphere of each area, whether to enhance productivity during the working day or to create ambience for evening events. Furthermore, the cost-efficiency of using a single device for multiple functions further solidified the decision. The installation encompassed a variety of spaces within Pavion’s new Raleigh facilities, including both formal and informal meeting rooms, personal offices, a lounge and reception area, open-plan workspaces and a Customer Experience Centre. A total of 75 ceiling-hung RAIL units were installed, providing the backbone for the entire system, and ensuring even and consistent coverage of both sound and light throughout the different spaces. RAIL is not only highly capable in terms of audio distribution but also contributes to the overall aesthetic of the office spaces, providing sleek and eye-catching lines of light that further modernise the space. The audio provided by RAIL is further enhanced by the integration of four K-array Rumble subwoofers, specifically in the reception area and Experience Centre. “We wanted to honour the shape of the space, so opted for RAIL arranged diagonally in the lounge and reception area,” explains VanderBrink. “This mirrors the shape of the external wall, something you cannot ordinarily do when designing lighting in an office space.” In terms of other technology, Pavion opted for LG video screens in each of its meeting rooms and personal office spaces, enabling crystal clear playback during video calls and presentations, whilst Poly Studio 2-in-1 microphone and camera units were chosen for their ease of use. In the Customer Experience Centre, a space to showcase Pavion’s extensive technology solutions includes a Jupiter wide-screen monitor, adding to the immersive experience established using eight RAIL units with integrated CASAMBI lighting control in an arrangement of four ‘L-shapes’. Pavion's unique design philosophy shines throughout the space, crafting a vibrant and immersive atmosphere during evening events with captivating RGB colour displays. “A key goal of this project was to provide a customer experience centre where we could host customer events and allow our clients to collaborate, design and be inspired in our new space,” continues VanderBrink. “We believe that every customer relationship starts with listening and understanding the drivers for each client and what is important to them. There is no “one size fits all” solution or design from our experienced team of low voltage engineers when it comes to accomplishing our customer’s vision. Our customer relationship is always our priority because it’s where we make the greatest difference for the people we serve. We believe in providing effortless customer experiences and the installation of RAIL within our Experience Centre helps us to achieve this.” The extensive system of RAIL units is powered by Kommander-KA68 amplifiers from K-array, with a dedicated amplifier driving audio to each zone. Not everyone embraces new technologies, such as RAIL, straight away. One of the principal challenges faced during the project was convincing general contractors who were often hesitant to adopt new technology. However, thanks to K-array and Pavion's training program and project support team, the contractor was successfully guided in adopting this innovative technology. This both resolved immediate challenges and potentially benefitted the contractor with an understanding of new technologies for future projects. As a result of this visionary integration project, Pavion can now enjoy a modern office and an engaging space to host its partners and clients. This office now serves as a hub for integrators with the added appeal of resonating with high-end architects, which is a benefit within the industries Pavion operates.

Since we share the same goals, working with Pavion has been a joy and a journey we can't wait to share with clients who are looking to re-design their office to be an inspiring and productive space. The entire system sounds great, from the Experience Centre to the conference rooms for video calls and the project presents a strong message about well-being but also about reducing costs with streamlined installation and lower maintenance.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/office-integration-pavion", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683045"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "From a constructional perspective what made the dual-purpose room possible was that the entire dance floor which sits just above the pool surface can be lowered through the water on hydraulic rams to become the floor of the pool, and raised again when required. This not only involved some heavy duty engineering but also required an intelligent approach to selecting and tuning a sound system to deliver its best in both pool and party modes. “We spoke to our clients about what speaker system options they could have, and as they’ve now experienced high performance sound in the cinema installation we had done for them previously they wanted full-on, no compromise, club audio,” commented Joe. “Our challenge was the natural acoustics of the pool room, a large and highly reverberant 20m by 12m space with very reflective ceiling and pool surface and a typical RT60 of well over 2 seconds. We knew that to achieve that goal we had to focus a lot of energy into a fairly narrow horizontal plane at around head height to minimise reflections and avoid exciting the room too much.” “They wanted the speaker system to complement the big mirror TV above the hot tub and be capable of going loud when the occasion demanded,” commented Joe. “So after modelling the room we recessed Python-KP102 line arrays either side of the TV, and a further four around the perimeter to give even coverage across the room. They’re RAL colour matched to the walls so they sit nicely with the look and feel of the space.” The subs, according to Joe, “were another story.” With no possibility to locate subs anywhere on the ground, the only viable option was to put them in the ceiling void. “The builder was nervous, the client was nervous, but when we showed them how it was going to be done and the result they could expect they were convinced. The KP102s are really efficient, and as our client wanted a really solid low end we installed eight Rumble-KU212s in the ceiling behind acoustically transparent cloth so the whole thing looks seamless. “Calibration was tricky due to the very different acoustic conditions between when the pool is open or covered, but we arrived at a sweet spot where it sounds good all round. The KP102s dispersion pattern is narrow in the vertical plane and that ensures sound is directed towards listeners’ ear level, while the wide horizontal pattern covers the large room really well. The modelling indicated where we might expect some nodes and troughs in the low end, so we took advantage of that to create some hot bass areas in front of the TV and in the bar area. It works a treat and they love it!” The support from 2B Heard has been fantastic, the whole experience has been great. To give you a timely example of first-rate support: we bought the amps about a year ago, not uncommon these days because COVID disrupted a lot of the supply chain, and consequently the amps needed firmware updates but so did the software that controls them. We’re here to do some calibration but we couldn’t do the updates on site so Matt Holland got on the phone straight away with K-array engineers and, in real time, went in through the back door and they’ve been updating the amplifiers as we speak, saving us an hour and a half drive to the office. How’s that for dedication?", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/spring-ponds", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683057"}, "embedding": null}

Both versions offer multichannel free routing and DSP with features such as grouping, input and output equalizers, level adjustment, dynamic limiters, and 4-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA14 I 4 4 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA34 4 4 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA104 4 4 2500W @ 4Ω 8-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA18 8 8 150W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA28 8 8 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA68 8 8 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA208 8 8 2500W @ 4Ω delay per channel. The key difference between IEB and IEB-pro is the expanded networking capabilities of the IEB-pro. These networking features are compatible with various professional audio protocols for managing digital audio streams, ensuring seamless integration with existing technologies and providing an optimal experience for integrators and system engineers. Network Types and Audio Protocols Standard IEB (Integrated Electronic Brain) The standard IEB includes one network port with fast Ethernet connection (1 Gigabit / 1.000 Mbps) and standard Wi-Fi with an internal access point. Wi-Fi connection can be extended through a router and amplifiers connected in Wi-Fi Client Mode. The physical network connection allows remote control via Ethernet and enables the following physical network topologies: • Standard Star Topology - (Control only - Wi-Fi switched off) • Standard Star topology - Control and DANTE network (primary network without redundancy - Wi-Fi switched off). With a single wired Ethernet connection, both control and audio streams are integrated into the same network flow. IEB-Pro The IEB-Pro is equipped with a 2-port network switch featuring Ethernet connections (1 Gigabit / 1000 Mbps), but does not include Wi-Fi capability. The supported network topologies are as follows: • Star Network Topology - Control only - amplifiers in single- port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante sharing the same network (amplifiers in single-port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante Redundancy (amplifiers in single port mode - redundancy requires two fully separated networks); • Star Network Topology - with Control and Dante Splitted( amplifiers in single-port mode) - split requires two fully separated networks; • Daisy Chain Network with Control (amplifiers set in bridge- mode) - not recommended for DanteTM. For more information on Dante network topologies and primary/ secondary port configurations, please refer to the dedicated chapter on DANTE network.

Since every host on a network must be identified by a unique IP address, the simplest local network usually implements a router/switch with a DHCP server managing the addresses allocation: by default the Kommander‑KA unit is set to obtain a local IP address from the DHCP server. In case a DHCP server is not present on the LAN, the unit goes in Auto IP mode: in few seconds the amplifier automatically self- assigns an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16. A static IP address can be assigned to the amplifier unit using the amplifier’s embedded web app (Network menu). It is possible to connect to the amplifiers wired to the switch via a Wi-Fi access point and configure them using the K-Connect app on a mobile device. Please ensure that the access point is connected to the same local network (LAN) as the switch to allow communication between all devices. When amplifiers are connected to the network via Ethrnet cables, it is recommended to disable the amplifiers built-in Wi-Fi hot- spot.

Kommander-KA User Guide 20 Network topology and network requirements Single Network - Star Topology Control + Digital Audio Streaming A star network configuration for single network amplifiers allows both remote control and digital audio streaming to run over the same network, providing centralized management and high-quality audio distribution. This setup ensures reliable performance and optimal bandwidth allocation for complex audio systems. A. First connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration and using ETH1 port. B. The same network configuration is used to control the amplifiers and utilize the Digital Audio Stream simultaneously. Single Network - Daisy Chain Control ONLY Daisy chaining network amplifiers allows multiple devices to be connected in daisy chain using a single network cable, streamlining installation and minimizing the need for additional switches. This configuration is ideal for remote control of amplifiers in multi-zone systems; however, it is not recommended for transmitting digital audio streams, as it may restrict bandwidth and degrade signal quality. Connecting the First Amplifier: 3. Connect the EHT1 port of the first amplifier to an external switch or network source. 4. Set the first amplifier to bridge mode. 5. Connect the EHT2 port of the first amplifier to the EHT1 port of the second amplifier. 6. Continue this pattern, connecting the EHT2 port of each amplifier to the EHT1 port of the next amplifier. Kommander-KA+ The Kommander-KA+ are equipped with the IEB-Pro platform, which, as we have seen, includes a switch with 2 ports for Ethernet-wired connections but does not have built-in Wi-Fi. Therefore, the primary access and control methods must be through a local network connected with Ethernet cables to a dedicated switch. • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel. The managing control softwares are the embedded Web- app, K-monitor or K-framework. Network settings (with DanteTM) • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel • disable the ENABLE AUTOIP function in the network tab. • Avoid Daisy-Chain if working with DanteTM. (Audinate, the manufacturer, does not recommend daisy-chaining through more than two hops, as this can cause latency issues and potentially disrupt the audio stream.) See the DanteReadyTM paragraph to more details. Built-in Wi-Fi is not present on KA+ - direct Wi-Fi connection is not possible - connection via an access point on the same LAN is supported for K-Connect use.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13959", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683325"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "USER GUIDE •20230515• Dante Ready implementation on K-array devices Activating Dante Ready KA18 KA28 KA68 KA208 KA14 KA34 KA104 Integrated Electronic Brain Activating Dante Ready User Guide 2 Thank you for choosing this K-array products! To ensure proper operation, please carefully read the owner’s manuals and safety instruction before using the products. After reading this manual, be sure to keep it for future reference. Dante is a proprietary digital media networking solution, developed by Audinate and licensed by K-array, which allows to convey audio content over standard Ethernet networks using the Internet Protocol (Audio over IP). When a K-array device receives Dante audio packets, it reconstructs them back into a continuous digital audio stream, which is then played out. The Dante audio implementation is 100% lossless 24- or 32-bit PCM, 48 kHz sample rate. K-array devices incorporate Dante as an optional software implemented solution, giving the user to get immediate, no- fuss connectivity over IP on demand. Dante Ready Dante Ready allows the user to purchase and add audio channels to a K-array device after initial purchase with easy-to- use software, paying only for as many channels as are required. Dante Controller Dante Controller software allows the user to configure signal routes and other settings. All routes and settings are stored in the individual Dante devices, allowing them to run without any connected computers. Dante Ready Activator scans the local Dante network for any Dante Ready eligible products and shows the available options; purchases are immediately applied to the target devices for a smooth, easy experience. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, Dante Controller must be updated to version 4.5.0.9 or later (February 2022) which includes Dante Ready Activator. Integrated Electronic Brain K-array active devices integrates a new generation intelligence software, named osKar, that allows the user to manage the entire system through various control platforms. With a real quad-core computer and embedded DSP featuring oskar, K-array devices offer enhanced signal processing and managing experience called IEB – Integrated Electronic Brain –giving the user control over the system performance. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, osKar must be updated to OS version 1.3.4 or later. K-array Dante Embedded Platforms K-array devices embedding Dante Ready born with no active Dante channels and can be upgraded to 2 IN x 2 OUT Dante channels (Ships with 0x0 / Upgradeable to 2x2).

{"content": "88 Terrace is a rooftop bar located at Bluewaters Island. The environment and spaces are enhanced thanks to live music, performances, and art installations. The 88 Terrace area features a futuristic industrial design style combined with art. Among the K-array range of products, the Python line was a good choice for 88 Terrace acoustic systems. The forty Python-KP52 speakers were selected and installed throughout the terrace. This passive speaker is a visually discreet audio system, and it seamlessly integrates into the architectural layouts of the terrace, without compromising the sound quality. To add exceptional lows and a cleaner sound to the venue’s frequency range, subwoofers from the Thunder line were selected. Thunder-KS1 and Thunder-KS2, are well known for their ultra-light and high-power sound. As part of the complete venue sound integration, the Ground, Second and Rooftop floors were all connected over a single Dante network.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/88-terrace", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683370"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "The Hungarian State Opera House is a neo-Renaissance building located in central Budapest. Inaugurated in 1884, this historic building is a landmark of the Hungarian capital and a cultural hub for both traditional and modern opera. As part of an overall renovation of the building, Budapest-based integrator Chromasound installed a full K-array loudspeaker solution across the auditorium and other key areas in the building - including the prestigious King’s Red Saloon - in line with the recommendations of sound system designer Andor Fürjes. “The use of loudspeaker systems in an opera house is controversial,” explains Fürjes. “Some say it is useful, but only to support sound effects. Others say an opera hall is a great place to gather for any purpose and in that case, it should have a loudspeaker system like any other multipurpose venue. Traditionally, architects don’t like to see anything that may obstruct the view or disturb the visual focus of what is happening on stage. People interested in monument protection will reject anything that might affect historic details or harm original structures. On the other hand, users and technicians dream of easy-to-use equipment that sounds musically pleasing and intelligible at all listening positions. Some of these conditions are present in most venues, but all of them were present in the design of Hungarian State Opera.” The system needed to be discreet, high-quality and win over those sceptical of allowing a loudspeaker system into a traditional opera hall. Preserving sightlines and fitting a renovation brief which focused on returning the Hungarian Opera House ‘back to the original’, was also of utmost importance. In a collaboration between Chromasound, Andor Fürjes and Hungarian distributor Audio Partner, a full K-array system of column loudspeakers, subwoofers and amplifiers was specified. “In the past, I’d had bad experiences with traditional column loudspeakers when trying to sound musical,” recalls Fürjes. “However, the first listening test of K-array products several years ago convinced me that it is possible to make full musical sound from even tiny-looking enclosures if done properly.” The slim form factor of K-array’s column loudspeakers alongside their range of customisable finishes also made them a great fit for this project as they could blend seamlessly into the historic environment. “The National Opera House has quite narrow wall surfaces at the stage opening, so bulky loudspeaker enclosures were not an option for architects” continues Fürjes, on the challenges posed by the venue. “Also, the renovation aimed for a more direct off-the-pit response and less carpeted surface, so the orchestra pit was moved into the audience area by one or two rows, resulting in a significantly larger proscenium stage area. The larger proscenium stage area also meant more potential risk of feedback, if the loudspeakers were to be installed at the stage opening.” Through EASE modelling, Fürjes confirmed the viability of a K-array system leading to the installation of eighteen Python and six Kobra line array loudspeakers, driven by Kommander amplifiers. Sub-bass is provided by the Thunder and Rumble series of subwoofers. Describing his design decisions, Fürjes explains, “The main loudspeakers were set to be as high as possible to provide more on-axis response from the stall seats up to the topmost listening positions. Subwoofers were exiled to the upper boxes next to the stage. Some subwoofers are installed below the stall seats floor for a more direct bass response.” Throughout the incredible King’s Red Saloon, fourteen ultra-flat aluminium line array element loudspeakers ensure discreet yet powerful sound. The preservation of the look and feel of the space was of great importance to this project, and the custom finishes offered by K-array helped with this. \"It was very easy to work with K-array loudspeakers,” says Chromasound installation engineer, Bálint Rédei. “We were wondering how the custom colours would fit into the environment but on opening the boxes, we saw immediately that the colours were superb and a perfect fit with the space. I especially liked the gold finish on the main PA column in the proscenium, and the tiny red-coloured Vyper loudspeakers, deployed in the corners of the King’s Red Saloon.” After much anticipation, the Hungarian State Opera reopened in 2022, with an interior renovation that has successfully returned this cultural gem to its former glory. With a full calendar of performances, the K-array system provides clear, reliable and discreet audio across a variety of use cases. Fürjes is positive about the result, “The loudspeaker system is visually just as elegant and graceful as it can be in this historical environment. I sincerely hope that at least some of the audience will be wondering where this great sound is coming from.”", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/budapest-opera-house", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683376"}, "embedding": null}

The K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units in demanding applications. The K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on-line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. The K-framework3 allows you to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available. Alternatively you can import from scratch in the workspace the real active loudspeakers and amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology in the same subnet. The K-framework3 operates in three modes: • 3D – Design a loudspeaker system for your venue in a fully 3D environment and make free field acoustic simulations; • SETUP – import from the 3D design the active components into the workspace or build from scratch a PA system composed of active loudspeakers and amplifiers; use the input and output groups to allow full control of the system; • TUNING – Manage and control the loudspeaker system in real time: optimize the performance of the loudspeaker system during the tuning session and control its behavior in live events. The network shall comprise: • single PC or MAC, running the K-framework3 software with network interface 100Mbps (or higher); • router with DHCP server 100Mbps (or higher); • Ethernet switch (usually integrated into the router) 100Mbps (or higher); • Cat5 (or higher) Ethernet cables. A DHCP server is highly recommended even if the Mugello-KH active units implement the zeroconf network technologies: if a DHCP service is not available, each Mugello-KH active array element will self assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16 (auto-IP). K-framework3 WINDOWS and OSX software K-framework3 Router/Switch with DHCP server Sidebar Toolbar Workspace Menu bar PC/MAC running the K-framework3 software Mugello-KH I User Guide 15 Grouping The working paradigm in the K-framework3 is to group the input and output channels of the active units on the workspace and adjust the system performance within the groups. Groups can be created working both off-line and on-line and are retained by the real units even once unplugged: if a real device belongs to a group, the group is re-created on the workspace during the synchronization process. An active loudspeaker or amplifier might belong to multiple groups sharing its features (eq filters, time delay, volume, etc). Discovery 1. Ensure that the Mugello-KH units and the PC/Mac running the K-framework3 are properly connected to the same network and belong to the same subnet. 2. Power up the Mugello-KH units. 3. Launch the K-framework3. 4. Open the Network window and launch the discovery: • For back compatibility with legacy Mugello-KH units, by default the discovery over the RS485 serial communication is active: in case no legacy Mugello-KH units are present, disable the discovery over the RS485 serial communication. 5. Once discovered, the real units are shown in the left columns, following the order of their ID number; if the workspace contains virtual devices of the same type you can eventually modify the IDs in order to match the units and allows the synchronization. The synchronization can be in either directions: Workspace-to-Real or Real-to- Workspace. Select the sync direction and synchronize all or the single units separately • If the K-framework3 finds two or more devices with the wrong ID, a dialog window appears where unique IDs can be assigned to the units. A. In Setup mode, set the Mugello-KH units local parameters (presets, routing, input gains, limiters, etc). B. Add INPUT and OUTPUT groups as needed. C. Assign the Mugello-KH units’ channels to the groups. D. Switch to Tuning mode. E. Align the system using the tools available on the groups (eq, delay, polarity, etc). The K-framework3 synchronization process reset to default the EQ, delay and volume parameters edited with the K-array Control mobile app and the embedded Web app. Mugello-KH I User Guide 16 Rigging Procedures Suspended Array Needed Equipment Name Description Image Apply to K-HCFLY2 I Bumper for KH2 I-KS3 I - BLACK KH2 I / KH2P I KS3 I / KS3P I K-HCFLY2W I Bumper for KH2 I-KS3 I - WHITE KH2 I / KH2P I KS3 I / KS3P I K-HCFLY35 I Bumper for KH5 I-KH3 I-KS4 I - BLACK KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KS4 I / KS4P I K-HCFLY35W I Bumper for KH5 I-KH3 I-KS4 I - WHITE KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KS4 I / KS4P I K-HCFLYST2 Fly bar for KH2 I step array KH2 I / KH2P I K-HCFLYST Fly bar for KH5 I-KH3 I step array KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I K-STEPM2 I Step array hardware for KH2 I (kit for 1 unit) KH2 I / KH2P I K-STEPM3 I Step array hardware for KH3 I (kit for 1 unit) KH3 I / KH3P I K-STEPM5 I Step array hardware for KH5 I (kit for 1 unit) KH5 I / KH5P I K-HCLINK2/35 Adapter to join KH2 I to a KH3 I or a KH5 I (or cluster) KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KH2 I / KH2P I Key rigging components must be inspected before each use.

After experiencing the usual challenges that most rental companies faced of high costs associated with loading time and transporting heavy speakers, the company founders set out to develop a better way of operating. Their results were revolutionary and, quite literally, out-of-the-box designs. The KH4 was developed to overcome these problems with over 4,000 W of onboard power, yet weighing around 100lbs and measuring only 6” deep. It was the first slim array technology speaker. Quick to assemble and deploy, easy to transport and delivering extremely high SPL with unprecedented quality for a wide variety of performance types and venue configurations, the flagship series helped establish K-array as a manufacturer of innovative pro audio solutions. Since then, K-array has maintained its reputation in the industry for revolutionary design by developing the next generation of touring systems – the Concert Series – and the top-of-the-line Firenze Systems, which include K-array’s distinctive Slim Array Technology (SAT). Just by looking at their compact profile, it’s apparent that SAT-featured products, such as the KH2, KH3, KH5, KH7 and KH8, are lightweight solutions which save space along with transportation costs, but users of the systems also enjoy little effort and time in setup and takedown and minimal visual impact on the venue. The practicality of transporting, the ease of assembly and the overall minimal footprint of the cluster are some of the advantages offered by SAT technology.. While these are significant benefits, the main advantage of SAT is that the compact design allows for a better impulse response with respect to a diffuser with a voluminous box and controls the horizontal directivity even at medium-low frequencies where traditional line arrays elements tend to be nearly omni-directional. K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com The figure below shows a typical configuration of a live event in which a stereo PA system is mounted. As mentioned, traditional line arrays have a low directivity on the horizontal plane below a certain frequency. The angle of the horizontal coverage, often greater than 180°, is very broad in the low frequency. Consequently, a large amount of energy is sent to center stage, the area where the orchestra is located, the front of the stage and towards the side walls. This results in numerous complications: • The emission of low frequency energy on the stage calls for an increased volume level of the monitors for the musicians, which consequently deteriorates the signal-to-noise ratio of the microphones and increases the difficulty in feedback management. • Similarly, the excess energy in the medium-low frequencies in the front rows leads to the need for very powerful front fill systems to ensure sufficient definition. Front fill systems driven at very high volumes worsen the definition of the sound on stage and further complicate the microphone placement. • The large amount of energy directed towards the center stage creates a big problem when there is an orchestra. The amount of gain available before triggering the feedback is greatly reduced, making it difficult to pickup the sound of instruments like the strings and piano. • The energy dispersed in the direction perpendicular to the array leads to an increase in reverberation in closed environments, such as theaters and auditoriums where PA systems are often installed in proximity to the walls. THE CHALLENGE Typical configuration of a live event in which a stereo PA system is mounted K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com THE SOLUTION This is where SAT comes in to save the day. In the initial developmental stages, the starting point was a sound baffle configuration. The natural energy dispersion of the acoustic baffle has a dipole characteristic or, in other words, a figure 8 dispersion. This seems to be a viable solution that can address the problem of minimizing the energy sent to the center stage, front stage and side walls. The drawback is that there is a strong emission in the rear of the system. In order to address this issue, the S.A.T. speakers have been mechanically designed to reduce and absorb sound emissions from the back panel. The resulting directivity does not manifest a figure 8, but looks more similar to a hyper-cardioid figure. This preserves the desired directivity and produces minimal back emissions. The following figure is a comparison of the horizontal dispersion of a standard 4-m long line array and a SAT system of the same length, consisting of 6 KH8 units per side. The use of the SAT system results in a reduction of sound pressure levels in the area occupied by the orchestra, at the front of the stage and on the side walls at an average of 12 dB in the medium-low range. Comparison of the energy distribution of a traditional PA system and a SAT system consisting of 6 KH8 units per side. The simulation shows the SPL values in a third octave band centered at 200 Hz. K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com The control of the directivity on the horizontal plane is not the only benefit of a diffuser devoid of a bulky box. Another advantage of SAT is a better impulse response than that of a conventional line array element. In truth, a direct-radiating bass reflex box uses a resonant air volume that tends to reduce the definition in the low-mid range and does not allow the correct reproduction of fast transients. Instead, SAT’s compact design allows sound to exit instantaneously without resonance, generating a significant amount of sound pressure in the low and low-mid range with a fast transient response. The hyper-cardioid dispersion in the low frequencies and an extremely fast impulse response are the true advantages of slim array speakers. The combination of these two factors leads to a significantly better acoustic outcome with respect to the traditional line array elements, particularly in terms of sound definition and noise pollution outside the desired audience areas. Additionally, the compactness of the speakers benefits the user through the practicality in transporting, the ease of assembly and the overall minimal footprint of the cluster which leads to an optimization of space, time and, therefore, total incurred costs for the management of these systems.

With a high directivity on the vertical plane, the line array’s sound beam can be focused on the audience area, ensuring greater intelligibility in highly reverberant environments and enabling uniform coverage of distances much greater than those attainable with traditional sources. Given this high directivity, the position of the cluster and the orientation of the individual speakers of which it is comprised are extremely critical parameters. In most applications, it is necessary to adjust the angles of an array in order to obtain the typical “banana” profile to direct the sound beam down towards the audience area. An error in the height of the cluster or the angles between the various units may significantly affect the quality of the sound on the audience area. Moreover, once the array is installed, it is no longer possible to modify the characteristics of the dispersion. It is here that the idea to digitally steer the sound beam generated by a line array was concieved. Imagine a number of sound sources all driven by the same signal. At any point within the space, the acoustic waves emitted by each source will interfere constructively or destructively, depending on the phase difference at that point. The interaction’s intensity, whether constructive or destructive, depends on the difference of the waves’ amplitude. Therefore, if each source’s signal phase and amplitude is controlled, it is possible to chose at which points we want the waves to sum and at which points we want the waves to cancel out each other. In other words, we can concentrate the sound energy in the space where it is needed, excluding areas that do not need to be affected by the sound beam. Signal K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com While this concept, identified as Digital Steering, might seem simple, it is actually very complex given that in space there are an infinite number of points where the waves interfere. In addition, the entire process is frequency dependent. Therefore, to obtain optimal results, it is necessary to manipulate each source’s signal with a very high frequency resolution. Digital Steering was initially implemented using the delay to vary the phase of the acoustic waves emitted by each line array element. The limitation of this approach is that the delay introduces a uniform delay at all frequencies and, therefore, does not allow the sound beam to be shaped independently at each frequency. This latter aspect is fundamental since the interaction between the acoustic waves emitted by each array element is a process that strongly depends on the frequency. Only by finely adjusting the phase and the amplitude of the signal frequency-by-frequency is it possible to obtain results of optimum steering, ensuring the same frequency response throughout the audience areas affected by the sound beam. This is possible only if FIR filters are used instead of the delay or traditional filters. The FIR filters (Finite Impulse Response) digital filters are characterized by the fact that their impulse response has a finite duration. Because they are digital filters, the input and output signals are sequences of discrete values, called samples. Each sample x that enters the filter is multiplied by a given coefficient b and added to the previous M Samples entered in the filter each multiplied by an appropriate coefficient. In other words, the value y[n] of the sample outgoing from the filter at the time n is the weighted average of the last M samples entered in the filter. The values of the coefficients can be selected to obtain the desired transfer function, which can be that of a simple traditional filter (low pass, high pass, shelving etc.) or even much more complex. FIR transfer function example K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com One of the properties that makes these filters ideal for digital steering is that they can alter the signal phase at a given frequency without altering the amplitude, and vice versa. If we consider that each FIR filter has hundreds of adjustable coefficients, it is not hard to believe that using them will allow you to manipulate the amplitude and phase of a signal with an extremely accurate frequency resolution. Obviously, the calculation of the FIR coefficients is not done by hand, but rather by a powerful software that has the responsibility of optimizing these values to obtain the desired acoustic result. For example, imagine a line array consisting of six KH2 elements each driven by a signal filtered by a FIR characterized by 400 coefficients. The software will have 6 x 400 = 2400 adjustable coefficients to ensure that the acoustic waves emitted by each line array element will interfere constructively in the audience area and interfere destructively where the sound pressure must be at a minimum i.e., the stage. Thanks to the very high number of coefficients in play, this steering process can be optimized frequency by frequency, ensuring optimal coverage throughout the entire audience area and reducing the noise pollution outside of this field. The following examples demonstrate how this technology allows the end user to have full sound beam control, achieving results which are unattainable using the traditional approach to digital steering. K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com APPLICATION EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 All examples shown have been created with EASE Focus acoustic simulation software. The simulations performed by the software are based on measured data at a very high resolution and are, therefore, totally representative of the actual behavior of the speaker. In the following images it is possible to see a plan view and a sectional view of an amphitheater where an audio system consisting of two clusters of 3 KH5 speakers is installed. The speakers are placed on the stage and oriented appropriately to ensure optimal coverage of entire audience area. The figures in the next pages demonstrate the simulation of the direct SPL in one octave band centered at 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz. 3 x KH5 units stacked Plan view and sectional view of an amphitheater where two clusters of 3 KH5 are installed K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com 1000 Hz Digital Steering bypassed Digital Steering active K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com 2000 Hz Digital Steering bypassed Digital Steering active K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com It is clear from the images that the activation of digital steering leads to a clear improvement in the sound coverage of the audience area. The optimization of the FIR filter coefficients redistributes the energy so that, rather than being focused on the section closest to the system, it is distributed evenly over all areas of interest. The most interesting thing to note is that the intervention of digital steering on the sound energy dispersion is very different in the two bands taken into consideration. At 1000 Hz, the sound beam is not parallel to the audience area resulting in a higher sound pressure build up in the front rows compared to the section farther from the system. Since they are no longer on the same axis of the sound beam, the first rows lose the energy surplus that was there before the FIR filters were applied. The digital optimization, therefore, tends to bend the beam upwards, so as to effectively redistribute the energy. Instead, at 2000 Hz the sound beam is already oriented in the right direction, so it does not need to be digitally bent. Rather, the digital optimization tends to reduce the angle of the vertical coverage so that the beam is better focused and can reach the back section of the audience with sufficient intensity. As explained above, only the use of FIR filters with a high number of coefficients can optimize the dispersion of the sound energy independently at each frequency. The application of a simple delay would not obtain the results shown in these examples. EXAMPLE 2 In the second example, two clusters comprised of three KH5 units are installed in the same amphitheater, but in a more extreme configuration. The clusters are suspended and left completely straight without any angle between the cabinets.

The sound energy is redistributed evenly rather than building up along the array’s axis. In many applications where there are restrictions on the cluster placement, the ability to effectively cover the audience area without having to utilize the typical banana profile is big advantage of the system CONCLUSION The ability to digitally adjust the dispersion of a line array element not only ensures the same listening experience to all audience members but, at the same time, limits the noise pollution in the areas where the sound pressure must be kept at a minimum. The use of FIR filters is the biggest advantage of our digital steering technology since it provides extremely high frequency resolutions, which would not be possible using delays and traditional filters. Digital steering is an important component of K-array’s Concert Series and Firenze Systems and, along with other important features such as premium materials and impeccable sound quality, puts K-array products on the forefront of cutting edge professional sound reinforcement.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/10565", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683516"}, "embedding": null}

However, there are wide variations internationally in the regulations and practices applying to suspension of sound systems in public places. Government officials in one location may have a stricter interpretation than another local official, even when operating under the same regulations and in the same legal jurisdiction. Consequently, users of K-array rigging systems should be prepared to take additional safety assurance measures beyond those outlined in this manual. in all cases, it is the responsibility of the user to make certain that any K-array loudspeaker system is suspended in accordance with all applicable national, federal, state, provincial, and local regulations. Attachment point: In most touring applications, the touring sound provider is normally responsible for ensuring the safety of the suspension system only below the attachment point. The safety and suitability of the attachment point is generally seen as the responsibility of the venue owner or operator. However, touring system operators should double check to make certain that attachment points are approved and suitably load rated and that the points used are those identified as such by the venue owner or operator. Personnel health and safety: During installation and setup, personnel should wear protective headgear and footwear at all times.

At 800,000 square feet, the hub consists of a train station, plaza and shopping mall that serves approximately 250,000 commuters each day and welcomes millions of visitors each year. For the Oculus, in the heart of the Westfield World Trade Center Mall, acoustic overseer and president of Busy Puppy Productions Ron Lorman, together with John Ackerman of VP Worldstage, needed a compact system on behalf of Westfield that was adaptable to various events held in the large space. Featuring electronic beam steering, 8 clusters of 4 Mugello-KH2 line array loudspeakers in white were selected for their precise and uniform coverage of the spacious area. And thanks to its Slim Array Technology, the KH2 offers high sound pressure with low back-end emission to direct the audio to the desired area. Each cluster was equipped with a K-Dante device that carries both the audio signal and the data to manage all the devices in the network for easy setup. I required a lightweight, focused system that provided high intelligibility to clearly project within the reverberant space and politely read over the potentially high floor noise of thousands of people. The Mugello system met all of these specifications.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/world-trade-center", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683604"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "K-array’s small-format Mugello-KH2 line array system delivers high impact and coverage for Rock Church’s 3,000-seat worship space, saving the congregation money, space and power. As one of the largest churches in San Bernardino, California, Rock Church required an upgrade to its sound system, however the full extent was not known until the old system was being disassembled: of the 19 flown loudspeakers, only one and a half were found to be fully functional. After conducting a thorough demo with many professional audio manufacturers, the church’s audio engineer Darwin Tillery and his team made the choice for K-array for its Electronic Beam Steerable technology and its compactness which subsequently led to time and cost savings. The new sound system featuring Mugello-KH2 line array loudspeakers is drawing rave reviews from the congregation and the church’s tech team since they installed the new PA. “Man, the system is unreal,” says Tillery, who, along with several years of leadership experience on HOW tech staff, toured as FOH engineer for high-profile performers like New Edition, Sheila E, The Platters, Mel Tillis, Englebert Humperdink, BVD and MC Hammer. “At Rock Church, we have almost 3,000 seats, and its super wide. We were at 100 dB with 103 peaks at 71 feet with just four boxes per side. These boxes sound much louder than they look. Everyone is just staring at it saying, ‘How are you getting it to breathe that way.’ With the full band we expected to run out of PA, but we didn’t. Nothing was harsh, we had chest thumping bass and it just works.” The system includes just four KH2 full-range boxes per side. Two Thunder-KMT21 subs per side --- one flown, one on the floor --- round out the self-powered three-way system. The KH2s include dual eight-inch woofers and dual 1.4-inch compression drivers. The KMT21 subs each have a single 21-inch woofer. “The way K-array crosses over from the subs is much higher than other manufacturers. It’s not what you’d expect when you’re crossing from 21-inch subs to the eight-inch drivers in the KH2s, but the sound is seamless and more musical,” according to Tillery. “We’re also going green by saving on power,” he adds. “The previous system required 14 30-amp circuits. The first week with the new system we ran with one 20-amp circuit per side.” The church has since added another 20-amp circuit per side since the breakers are old and potentially unreliable. None of the other systems we demoed had the digital steering. Also, with K-array we were able to go with the smallest loudspeaker hang to preserve our site lines to our side screens. Fewer boxes saved lots of money and we saved on weight, so less rigging was required. There was no structural engineering either since the new system was a fraction of the weight of our previous system.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/rock-church", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683610"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Guitar en Scene is a niche music festival for a small audience of 5,500 in Saint-Julien-en-Genevois featuring world class guitarists. When the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary, performances included international talents like Santana, Twisted Sister, Joe Satriani and Dweezil Zappa, and featured our Mugello line on the Village Stage. A cluster of six Mugello-KH5 line array elements per side were paired with eight Mugello-KS5 subwoofers displayed as a four stack of two in the middle, spaced center to center. Two KH2 loudspeakers were used as center fill. On a separate, smaller stage, a Pinnacle-KR802 portable system was flown in an LR configuration with the subwoofers located centrally. With so many great performances and positive feedback from their peers, French distributor, Appel Electronique Industries, was satisfied with the end results; the performances flowed naturally and were musically dynamic. The Mugello system provided excellent coverage of the space, even at 50 meters from the stage. We could hear the entire frequency range. With the subwoofers, their setup at minus 15dB provided more than enough and the results were amazing. They reached all the way to the back of the audience.\"", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/guitar-en-scene", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683618"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "The New York Philharmonic presentation of four Star Wars films – A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and The Force Awakens – at Lincoln Center in Manhattan was presented in surround at 2,700-seat David Geffen Hall, and consisted of the film screenings accompanied by John Williams’ iconic score performed live by the 100-plus piece orchestra conducted by David Newman. One of the biggest tests for the audio team was to make the concert hall feel more like a movie house; ensuring the dialogue was clear, the effects physically palpable, and that the orchestra was able to successfully perform the soundtrack without “blowing people out of their seats.” Among the aspects of the sound design requiring a great deal of consideration and planning were an orchestra clocking in at about 92-plus dB, the necessity of placing surround elements (as well as subwoofers) in close proximity to audience members, and maintaining sonic imagery in locations presenting far greater challenges than the average movie theater. After trying many different speaker configurations, K-array proved a be key to coverage because of its electronic beam steering and was ultimately selected to comprise the main PA along with the venue’s permanently installed subwoofers. The main system center cluster consisted of six Mugello-KH2 active line array elements flown at the center of the stage proscenium and flanked by a cardioid subwoofer on each side. Left, center and right (LCR) main arrays, also flown at the proscenium, were also comprised of Mugello-KH2s, each with seven elements. For rear surround a dozen Pinnacle-KR102 portable systems were employed with three Pinnacle-KR102 systems per seating level, placed left, center and right, joined by companion subs and a satellite array for emphasis on higher frequency content. The compact sub elements of the Pinnacles were key in bolstering low-end reinforcement, particularly that of FX and source material.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/lincoln-center", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683623"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Formed in 1986 by brothers Matt and Luke Goss plus drummer Craig Logan, Bros were one of the most successful pop acts of the late 1980s. After selling out the band’s 2017 reunion dates at London’s iconic O2 Arena O2 in seconds, expectations were high for the two-night event, staged by Leeds-based Production North. The Bros concerts were based upon live instrumentation as well as a range of lead and backing vocals, requiring a powerful, versatile touring system in one of the world’s most prestigious live music venues. So Production North worked with distributors 2B Heard to provide a core front of house system comprised of the Firenze Series for seamless, full venue coverage for return of 80s superstars. Just 12 Firenze-KH8 panels per side were flown to deliver consistent coverage, while six IP65-rated Firenze-KS8 subwoofers per side provided low-end extension. In addition, two discreet side hangs comprised three Mugello-KH3 concert series panels plus four Mugello-KH2 down fills per side. System optimization to suit the venue was achieved simply with AFMG’s EASE Focus software, which also forms the control interface for the creation of all required FIR algorithms, ensuring quick and simple operation over a single, trusted platform. Additionally, all of the Powersoft amplifier modules are IP addressable, enabling quick and seamless configuration updates. The local crew from Stage Miracles, as well as the team from Production North were astonished by the speed and ease with which the Firenze system can be setup and flown: compact enough to occupy a fraction of the truck-space required for more traditional PA systems, Firenze can be unpacked and rigged in minutes by a one-man team. It’s an intriguing sound system. It seems to me very much like the rigging was designed and box was made to fit but it still sounds good, which is an amazing feat. In general, the coverage that you can achieve and the intelligence of the system in terms of both rigging and audio quality is exceptional. The way it rigs, the speed with which it rigs and the lack of space it needs in a truck; it’s all impressive!", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/bros-o2", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683630"}, "embedding": null}

The K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units in demanding applications. The K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on-line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. The K-framework3 allows you to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available. Alternatively you can import from scratch in the workspace the real active loudspeakers and amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology in the same subnet. The K-framework3 operates in three modes: • 3D – Design a loudspeaker system for your venue in a fully 3D environment and make free field acoustic simulations; • SETUP – import from the 3D design the active components into the workspace or build from scratch a PA system composed of active loudspeakers and amplifiers; use the input and output groups to allow full control of the system; • TUNING – Manage and control the loudspeaker system in real time: optimize the performance of the loudspeaker system during the tuning session and control its behavior in live events. The network shall comprise: • single PC or MAC, running the K-framework3 software with network interface 100Mbps (or higher); • router with DHCP server 100Mbps (or higher); • Ethernet switch (usually integrated into the router) 100Mbps (or higher); • Cat5 (or higher) Ethernet cables. A DHCP server is highly recommended even if the Mugello-KH active units implement the zeroconf network technologies: if a DHCP service is not available, each Mugello-KH active array element will self assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16 (auto-IP). K-framework3 WINDOWS and OSX software K-framework3 Router/Switch with DHCP server Sidebar Toolbar Workspace Menu bar PC/MAC running the K-framework3 software Mugello-KH I User Guide 15 Grouping The working paradigm in the K-framework3 is to group the input and output channels of the active units on the workspace and adjust the system performance within the groups. Groups can be created working both off-line and on-line and are retained by the real units even once unplugged: if a real device belongs to a group, the group is re-created on the workspace during the synchronization process. An active loudspeaker or amplifier might belong to multiple groups sharing its features (eq filters, time delay, volume, etc). Discovery 1. Ensure that the Mugello-KH units and the PC/Mac running the K-framework3 are properly connected to the same network and belong to the same subnet. 2. Power up the Mugello-KH units. 3. Launch the K-framework3. 4. Open the Network window and launch the discovery: • For back compatibility with legacy Mugello-KH units, by default the discovery over the RS485 serial communication is active: in case no legacy Mugello-KH units are present, disable the discovery over the RS485 serial communication. 5. Once discovered, the real units are shown in the left columns, following the order of their ID number; if the workspace contains virtual devices of the same type you can eventually modify the IDs in order to match the units and allows the synchronization. The synchronization can be in either directions: Workspace-to-Real or Real-to- Workspace. Select the sync direction and synchronize all or the single units separately • If the K-framework3 finds two or more devices with the wrong ID, a dialog window appears where unique IDs can be assigned to the units. A. In Setup mode, set the Mugello-KH units local parameters (presets, routing, input gains, limiters, etc). B. Add INPUT and OUTPUT groups as needed. C. Assign the Mugello-KH units’ channels to the groups. D. Switch to Tuning mode. E. Align the system using the tools available on the groups (eq, delay, polarity, etc). The K-framework3 synchronization process reset to default the EQ, delay and volume parameters edited with the K-array Control mobile app and the embedded Web app. Mugello-KH I User Guide 16 Rigging Procedures Suspended Array Needed Equipment Name Description Image Apply to K-HCFLY2 I Bumper for KH2 I-KS3 I - BLACK KH2 I / KH2P I KS3 I / KS3P I K-HCFLY2W I Bumper for KH2 I-KS3 I - WHITE KH2 I / KH2P I KS3 I / KS3P I K-HCFLY35 I Bumper for KH5 I-KH3 I-KS4 I - BLACK KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KS4 I / KS4P I K-HCFLY35W I Bumper for KH5 I-KH3 I-KS4 I - WHITE KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KS4 I / KS4P I K-HCFLYST2 Fly bar for KH2 I step array KH2 I / KH2P I K-HCFLYST Fly bar for KH5 I-KH3 I step array KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I K-STEPM2 I Step array hardware for KH2 I (kit for 1 unit) KH2 I / KH2P I K-STEPM3 I Step array hardware for KH3 I (kit for 1 unit) KH3 I / KH3P I K-STEPM5 I Step array hardware for KH5 I (kit for 1 unit) KH5 I / KH5P I K-HCLINK2/35 Adapter to join KH2 I to a KH3 I or a KH5 I (or cluster) KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KH2 I / KH2P I Key rigging components must be inspected before each use.

SAFETY INFORMATION Laws and regulations: The suspension of large, heavy objects in public places is subject to numerous laws and regulations at the national, federal, state, provincial, and local levels. This manual does not address the specifics of any such applicable laws and government regulations. This manual details procedures and practices consistent with those generally acknowledged as allowable and safe in Europe. However, the user must assume responsibility for making sure that use of any K-array system and its components in any particular circumstance or venue conforms to all applicable laws and regulations in force at the time. Safety factor: K-HCFLY and K-HCFLY2 are in conformity with UNI EN 13155:2009. The safety factor is equal to 7:1 on the breaking load (up to 12 KH5 or 12 KH3 or 16 KH2 can be suspended with a K-HCFLY and up to 12 KH2 can be suspended with a K-HCFLY2). However, there are wide variations internationally in the regulations and practices applying to suspension of sound systems in public places. Government officials in one location may have a stricter interpretation than another local official, even when operating under the same regulations and in the same legal jurisdiction. Consequently, users of K-array rigging systems should be prepared to take additional safety assurance measures beyond those outlined in this manual. in all cases, it is the responsibility of the user to make certain that any K-array loudspeaker system is suspended in accordance with all applicable national, federal, state, provincial, and local regulations. Attachment point: In most touring applications, the touring sound provider is normally responsible for ensuring the safety of the suspension system only below the attachment point. The safety and suitability of the attachment point is generally seen as the responsibility of the venue owner or operator. However, touring system operators should double check to make certain that attachment points are approved and suitably load rated and that the points used are those identified as such by the venue owner or operator. Personnel health and safety: During installation and setup, personnel should wear protective headgear and footwear at all times. Under no circumstances should personnel climb on the loudspeaker assembly. Wind loads: In case of outdoor installation, assure that wind does not interfere with the system’s stability, taking extra securities like chains, weights, ropes or any other certified anchoring systems. Ground stacking: Do not ground stack a cluster on uneven ground or platform. If the system is ground stacked on a structure, platform or stage always check that it can support the total weight of the system. Read these instructions - Keep these instructions - Heed all warnings Warning: failure to follow these safety instructions could result in fire, shock or other injury or damage to the device or other property. 17,9in 455,77mm 47,1in 1195,08mm 43,5in 1104mm 14,6in 370mm 8,3in 209,95mm 20,5 in 520 mm 23,6 in 599,8 mm 8,3 in 210 mm 47,0 in 1194,6 mm 49,6 in 1260 mm Suspending the Concert Series Ver. 1.1 7 Weight 61.2 kg (134.9 lbs) 4.

In its fourth season, the competition has installed a K-array system for audio reinforcement much to the success of the program. Six Mugello-KH3 are divided and flown on the both sides of the stage as well as the back of the auditorium to implement a surround sound experience for the live audience. For the center fill, designers have chosen six Mugello-KH2 line array elements placed above the stage to provide central, high-energy coverage for the wide stage in a hanging setup that issues strong voice.

{"content": "The Primo Maggio Concert is an Italian all-day music festival organized annually on the first of May to celebrate the Labor Day holiday. Set in Piazza San Giovanni in Rome and broadcast live on public television, this popular national event is also referred to as the Concertone or “Big Concert” due to the duration of the musical marathon which begins in the afternoon and ends late at night due to the sheer volume of artists and audience. For the 28th edition if the festival, stage managers Toni Soddu and Alessio Martino from ALTO Stage Management entrusted the audio domain entirely to K-array to provide high quality sound for the 50+ performances, including international artist Fat Boy Slim, and the 500,000 people present. Product specialist and system designer Klaus Hausherr, together with Roberto Marchesi from Italian distributor Exhibo, developed a powerful, versatile main system using 24 Firenze-KH8 line elements with Slim Array Technology and Electronic Beam Steering paired with 16 Firenze-KS8 subwoofers. 6 Mugello-KH3 line arrays were used as front fill while the delay line was made with 4 Firenze-KH7 and the lateral delay lines made up of 10 Mugello-KH2 loudspeakers on each side. The onstage monitoring was comprised of a side fill system with 6 Mugello-KH5 paired with 4 Mugello-KS5 subwoofers. Four powerful Mastiff-KM312 and 14 Mastiff-KM112 speakers were used for floor monitors and the drum-fill was made up of 2 Thunder-KMT21 subwoofers and 2 Dragon-KX12 elements. Two sets of Axle-KRX202 portable systems were used as a near fill for the FOH sound engineers, one for each FOH mixer. The artists’ sound engineers, including resident FOH Davide Linzi and Simone Squillario along with Sound Management for ABC rental company, Marco Lecci, were impressed with the coverage and uniformity of the system. And its power was evident, reaching an LAeq of 106 SPL at FOH. Usually at music festivals, it’s difficult to find a set standard of audio quality that accommodates all the artists and their performances of different genres. But with the versatility and power of the Firenze system at Primo Maggio, we were able to meet everyone’s needs. The system not only sounded great but looked great too!", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/primo-maggio-festival", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683943"}, "embedding": null}

Located in the heart of the nightlife precinct of Central, Hong Kong, Yojimbo replicates the underground world of Japanese clubbing through its international DJs, entertainment features and cocktails similar to the underground Ginza lanes of Tokyo. Yojimbo is a slightly bigger space than many of Hong Kong’s bars or clubs yet a discreet system of four Vyper-KV52 line array elements and two Rumble-KU210 subwoofers powered by a Kommander-KA14 amp was enough DSP to cover the lobby bar area. The main room functions as a nightclub so a more powerful line array of Mugello-KH3 loudspeakers were flown on either side of the DJ booth paired with a Mugello-KS5 subwoofer underneath it. Completing the setup, a pair of smaller Mugello-KH2 powered line array elements has been installed on the opposite wall. K-array is a really good company to work with. Their speakers are very good quality, but what’s also attractive is the opportunity to work with some quality people, such as [president of global sales] Marc Vincent who lives right here on Hong Kong Island and gets very involved with our installations.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/yojimbo", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683950"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "NY CityFest hosted Luis Palau and dozens of other partner evangelists with a free concert and gospel sermons at Central Park in Manhattan. With 60,000 in attendance plus another 20,000 people encircling the perimeter and an additional audience in virtual attendance globally via radio, television and live internet streaming, the pressure was high to provide clear and quality sound throughout the entire event. Extending 55 acres and measuring a length of 400m, the venue required a main PA with 2 line delays to cover the large area. The K-array arsenal included a wall of twelve Firenze-KH8 line array elements paired with eight Firenze-KS8 subwoofers per side. Two Mugello-KH3 loudspeakers were paired with two Mugello-KS5 subwoofers for stage side fills to the left and the right of the performers. Four Mugello-KH2 loudspeakers were originally planned for front fill coverage, but with the impressive digital steering and 120° horizontal coverage of the Firenze-KH8, they were no longer needed. The side fill amazed both the artists and sound engineers who were surprised by the power of the Mugello-KS5 despite their size. And the sound quality was even and seamless all over the stage that some of the performers didn’t even use wedge monitors. At Delay Towers 1 and 2, a long array of five Firenze-KH7 loudspeakers was flown vertically. They were paired with three Mugello-KS5 subwoofers each that withstood a couple hours of heavy rain then extended periods of typical New York summer heat. The final set of towers consisted of four Mugello-KH4 loudspeakers with 8 Mugello-KS4 subwoofers each. I was skeptical since I had never seen a system set up like that before and, on such a large platform with a global audience, we had little room for error. But I was extremely pleased with the power, coverage and accuracy right out of the box! I was inspired by the clarity of the PA and found myself making the tiniest changes to the mix, and enjoyed hearing those tiny changes.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/luis-palau", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.683956"}, "embedding": null}

The K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units in demanding applications. The K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on-line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. The K-framework3 allows you to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available. Alternatively you can import from scratch in the workspace the real active loudspeakers and amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology in the same subnet. The K-framework3 operates in three modes: • 3D – Design a loudspeaker system for your venue in a fully 3D environment and make free field acoustic simulations; • SETUP – import from the 3D design the active components into the workspace or build from scratch a PA system composed of active loudspeakers and amplifiers; use the input and output groups to allow full control of the system; • TUNING – Manage and control the loudspeaker system in real time: optimize the performance of the loudspeaker system during the tuning session and control its behavior in live events. The network shall comprise: • single PC or MAC, running the K-framework3 software with network interface 100Mbps (or higher); • router with DHCP server 100Mbps (or higher); • Ethernet switch (usually integrated into the router) 100Mbps (or higher); • Cat5 (or higher) Ethernet cables. A DHCP server is highly recommended even if the Mugello-KH active units implement the zeroconf network technologies: if a DHCP service is not available, each Mugello-KH active array element will self assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16 (auto-IP). K-framework3 WINDOWS and OSX software K-framework3 Router/Switch with DHCP server Sidebar Toolbar Workspace Menu bar PC/MAC running the K-framework3 software Mugello-KH I User Guide 15 Grouping The working paradigm in the K-framework3 is to group the input and output channels of the active units on the workspace and adjust the system performance within the groups. Groups can be created working both off-line and on-line and are retained by the real units even once unplugged: if a real device belongs to a group, the group is re-created on the workspace during the synchronization process. An active loudspeaker or amplifier might belong to multiple groups sharing its features (eq filters, time delay, volume, etc). Discovery 1. Ensure that the Mugello-KH units and the PC/Mac running the K-framework3 are properly connected to the same network and belong to the same subnet. 2. Power up the Mugello-KH units. 3. Launch the K-framework3. 4. Open the Network window and launch the discovery: • For back compatibility with legacy Mugello-KH units, by default the discovery over the RS485 serial communication is active: in case no legacy Mugello-KH units are present, disable the discovery over the RS485 serial communication. 5. Once discovered, the real units are shown in the left columns, following the order of their ID number; if the workspace contains virtual devices of the same type you can eventually modify the IDs in order to match the units and allows the synchronization. The synchronization can be in either directions: Workspace-to-Real or Real-to- Workspace. Select the sync direction and synchronize all or the single units separately • If the K-framework3 finds two or more devices with the wrong ID, a dialog window appears where unique IDs can be assigned to the units. A. In Setup mode, set the Mugello-KH units local parameters (presets, routing, input gains, limiters, etc). B. Add INPUT and OUTPUT groups as needed. C. Assign the Mugello-KH units’ channels to the groups. D. Switch to Tuning mode. E. Align the system using the tools available on the groups (eq, delay, polarity, etc). The K-framework3 synchronization process reset to default the EQ, delay and volume parameters edited with the K-array Control mobile app and the embedded Web app. Mugello-KH I User Guide 16 Rigging Procedures Suspended Array Needed Equipment Name Description Image Apply to K-HCFLY2 I Bumper for KH2 I-KS3 I - BLACK KH2 I / KH2P I KS3 I / KS3P I K-HCFLY2W I Bumper for KH2 I-KS3 I - WHITE KH2 I / KH2P I KS3 I / KS3P I K-HCFLY35 I Bumper for KH5 I-KH3 I-KS4 I - BLACK KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KS4 I / KS4P I K-HCFLY35W I Bumper for KH5 I-KH3 I-KS4 I - WHITE KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KS4 I / KS4P I K-HCFLYST2 Fly bar for KH2 I step array KH2 I / KH2P I K-HCFLYST Fly bar for KH5 I-KH3 I step array KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I K-STEPM2 I Step array hardware for KH2 I (kit for 1 unit) KH2 I / KH2P I K-STEPM3 I Step array hardware for KH3 I (kit for 1 unit) KH3 I / KH3P I K-STEPM5 I Step array hardware for KH5 I (kit for 1 unit) KH5 I / KH5P I K-HCLINK2/35 Adapter to join KH2 I to a KH3 I or a KH5 I (or cluster) KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KH2 I / KH2P I Key rigging components must be inspected before each use.

However, the user must assume responsibility for making sure that use of any K-array system and its components in any particular circumstance or venue conforms to all applicable laws and regulations in force at the time. Safety factor: K-HCFLY and K-HCFLY2 are in conformity with UNI EN 13155:2009. The safety factor is equal to 7:1 on the breaking load (up to 12 KH5 or 12 KH3 or 16 KH2 can be suspended with a K-HCFLY and up to 12 KH2 can be suspended with a K-HCFLY2). However, there are wide variations internationally in the regulations and practices applying to suspension of sound systems in public places. Government officials in one location may have a stricter interpretation than another local official, even when operating under the same regulations and in the same legal jurisdiction. Consequently, users of K-array rigging systems should be prepared to take additional safety assurance measures beyond those outlined in this manual. in all cases, it is the responsibility of the user to make certain that any K-array loudspeaker system is suspended in accordance with all applicable national, federal, state, provincial, and local regulations. Attachment point: In most touring applications, the touring sound provider is normally responsible for ensuring the safety of the suspension system only below the attachment point. The safety and suitability of the attachment point is generally seen as the responsibility of the venue owner or operator. However, touring system operators should double check to make certain that attachment points are approved and suitably load rated and that the points used are those identified as such by the venue owner or operator. Personnel health and safety: During installation and setup, personnel should wear protective headgear and footwear at all times. Under no circumstances should personnel climb on the loudspeaker assembly. Wind loads: In case of outdoor installation, assure that wind does not interfere with the system’s stability, taking extra securities like chains, weights, ropes or any other certified anchoring systems. Ground stacking: Do not ground stack a cluster on uneven ground or platform. If the system is ground stacked on a structure, platform or stage always check that it can support the total weight of the system.

{"content": "K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com An Introduction to Digital Steering The line array’s introduction to the professional audio market in the 90s signaled a revolution for both live concert applications and installations. With a high directivity on the vertical plane, the line array’s sound beam can be focused on the audience area, ensuring greater intelligibility in highly reverberant environments and enabling uniform coverage of distances much greater than those attainable with traditional sources. Given this high directivity, the position of the cluster and the orientation of the individual speakers of which it is comprised are extremely critical parameters. In most applications, it is necessary to adjust the angles of an array in order to obtain the typical “banana” profile to direct the sound beam down towards the audience area. An error in the height of the cluster or the angles between the various units may significantly affect the quality of the sound on the audience area. Moreover, once the array is installed, it is no longer possible to modify the characteristics of the dispersion. It is here that the idea to digitally steer the sound beam generated by a line array was concieved. Imagine a number of sound sources all driven by the same signal. At any point within the space, the acoustic waves emitted by each source will interfere constructively or destructively, depending on the phase difference at that point. The interaction’s intensity, whether constructive or destructive, depends on the difference of the waves’ amplitude. Therefore, if each source’s signal phase and amplitude is controlled, it is possible to chose at which points we want the waves to sum and at which points we want the waves to cancel out each other. In other words, we can concentrate the sound energy in the space where it is needed, excluding areas that do not need to be affected by the sound beam. Signal K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com While this concept, identified as Digital Steering, might seem simple, it is actually very complex given that in space there are an infinite number of points where the waves interfere. In addition, the entire process is frequency dependent. Therefore, to obtain optimal results, it is necessary to manipulate each source’s signal with a very high frequency resolution. Digital Steering was initially implemented using the delay to vary the phase of the acoustic waves emitted by each line array element. The limitation of this approach is that the delay introduces a uniform delay at all frequencies and, therefore, does not allow the sound beam to be shaped independently at each frequency. This latter aspect is fundamental since the interaction between the acoustic waves emitted by each array element is a process that strongly depends on the frequency. Only by finely adjusting the phase and the amplitude of the signal frequency-by-frequency is it possible to obtain results of optimum steering, ensuring the same frequency response throughout the audience areas affected by the sound beam. This is possible only if FIR filters are used instead of the delay or traditional filters. The FIR filters (Finite Impulse Response) digital filters are characterized by the fact that their impulse response has a finite duration. Because they are digital filters, the input and output signals are sequences of discrete values, called samples. Each sample x that enters the filter is multiplied by a given coefficient b and added to the previous M Samples entered in the filter each multiplied by an appropriate coefficient. In other words, the value y[n] of the sample outgoing from the filter at the time n is the weighted average of the last M samples entered in the filter. The values of the coefficients can be selected to obtain the desired transfer function, which can be that of a simple traditional filter (low pass, high pass, shelving etc.) or even much more complex. FIR transfer function example K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com One of the properties that makes these filters ideal for digital steering is that they can alter the signal phase at a given frequency without altering the amplitude, and vice versa. If we consider that each FIR filter has hundreds of adjustable coefficients, it is not hard to believe that using them will allow you to manipulate the amplitude and phase of a signal with an extremely accurate frequency resolution. Obviously, the calculation of the FIR coefficients is not done by hand, but rather by a powerful software that has the responsibility of optimizing these values to obtain the desired acoustic result. For example, imagine a line array consisting of six KH2 elements each driven by a signal filtered by a FIR characterized by 400 coefficients. The software will have 6 x 400 = 2400 adjustable coefficients to ensure that the acoustic waves emitted by each line array element will interfere constructively in the audience area and interfere destructively where the sound pressure must be at a minimum i.e., the stage. Thanks to the very high number of coefficients in play, this steering process can be optimized frequency by frequency, ensuring optimal coverage throughout the entire audience area and reducing the noise pollution outside of this field. The following examples demonstrate how this technology allows the end user to have full sound beam control, achieving results which are unattainable using the traditional approach to digital steering.

The simulations performed by the software are based on measured data at a very high resolution and are, therefore, totally representative of the actual behavior of the speaker. In the following images it is possible to see a plan view and a sectional view of an amphitheater where an audio system consisting of two clusters of 3 KH5 speakers is installed. The speakers are placed on the stage and oriented appropriately to ensure optimal coverage of entire audience area. The figures in the next pages demonstrate the simulation of the direct SPL in one octave band centered at 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz. 3 x KH5 units stacked Plan view and sectional view of an amphitheater where two clusters of 3 KH5 are installed K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com 1000 Hz Digital Steering bypassed Digital Steering active K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com 2000 Hz Digital Steering bypassed Digital Steering active K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com It is clear from the images that the activation of digital steering leads to a clear improvement in the sound coverage of the audience area. The optimization of the FIR filter coefficients redistributes the energy so that, rather than being focused on the section closest to the system, it is distributed evenly over all areas of interest. The most interesting thing to note is that the intervention of digital steering on the sound energy dispersion is very different in the two bands taken into consideration. At 1000 Hz, the sound beam is not parallel to the audience area resulting in a higher sound pressure build up in the front rows compared to the section farther from the system. Since they are no longer on the same axis of the sound beam, the first rows lose the energy surplus that was there before the FIR filters were applied. The digital optimization, therefore, tends to bend the beam upwards, so as to effectively redistribute the energy. Instead, at 2000 Hz the sound beam is already oriented in the right direction, so it does not need to be digitally bent. Rather, the digital optimization tends to reduce the angle of the vertical coverage so that the beam is better focused and can reach the back section of the audience with sufficient intensity. As explained above, only the use of FIR filters with a high number of coefficients can optimize the dispersion of the sound energy independently at each frequency. The application of a simple delay would not obtain the results shown in these examples. EXAMPLE 2 In the second example, two clusters comprised of three KH5 units are installed in the same amphitheater, but in a more extreme configuration. The clusters are suspended and left completely straight without any angle between the cabinets.

The sound energy is redistributed evenly rather than building up along the array’s axis. In many applications where there are restrictions on the cluster placement, the ability to effectively cover the audience area without having to utilize the typical banana profile is big advantage of the system CONCLUSION The ability to digitally adjust the dispersion of a line array element not only ensures the same listening experience to all audience members but, at the same time, limits the noise pollution in the areas where the sound pressure must be kept at a minimum. The use of FIR filters is the biggest advantage of our digital steering technology since it provides extremely high frequency resolutions, which would not be possible using delays and traditional filters. Digital steering is an important component of K-array’s Concert Series and Firenze Systems and, along with other important features such as premium materials and impeccable sound quality, puts K-array products on the forefront of cutting edge professional sound reinforcement.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/10621", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.684252"}, "embedding": null}

After experiencing the usual challenges that most rental companies faced of high costs associated with loading time and transporting heavy speakers, the company founders set out to develop a better way of operating. Their results were revolutionary and, quite literally, out-of-the-box designs. The KH4 was developed to overcome these problems with over 4,000 W of onboard power, yet weighing around 100lbs and measuring only 6” deep. It was the first slim array technology speaker. Quick to assemble and deploy, easy to transport and delivering extremely high SPL with unprecedented quality for a wide variety of performance types and venue configurations, the flagship series helped establish K-array as a manufacturer of innovative pro audio solutions. Since then, K-array has maintained its reputation in the industry for revolutionary design by developing the next generation of touring systems – the Concert Series – and the top-of-the-line Firenze Systems, which include K-array’s distinctive Slim Array Technology (SAT). Just by looking at their compact profile, it’s apparent that SAT-featured products, such as the KH2, KH3, KH5, KH7 and KH8, are lightweight solutions which save space along with transportation costs, but users of the systems also enjoy little effort and time in setup and takedown and minimal visual impact on the venue. The practicality of transporting, the ease of assembly and the overall minimal footprint of the cluster are some of the advantages offered by SAT technology.. While these are significant benefits, the main advantage of SAT is that the compact design allows for a better impulse response with respect to a diffuser with a voluminous box and controls the horizontal directivity even at medium-low frequencies where traditional line arrays elements tend to be nearly omni-directional. K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com The figure below shows a typical configuration of a live event in which a stereo PA system is mounted. As mentioned, traditional line arrays have a low directivity on the horizontal plane below a certain frequency. The angle of the horizontal coverage, often greater than 180°, is very broad in the low frequency. Consequently, a large amount of energy is sent to center stage, the area where the orchestra is located, the front of the stage and towards the side walls. This results in numerous complications: • The emission of low frequency energy on the stage calls for an increased volume level of the monitors for the musicians, which consequently deteriorates the signal-to-noise ratio of the microphones and increases the difficulty in feedback management. • Similarly, the excess energy in the medium-low frequencies in the front rows leads to the need for very powerful front fill systems to ensure sufficient definition. Front fill systems driven at very high volumes worsen the definition of the sound on stage and further complicate the microphone placement. • The large amount of energy directed towards the center stage creates a big problem when there is an orchestra. The amount of gain available before triggering the feedback is greatly reduced, making it difficult to pickup the sound of instruments like the strings and piano. • The energy dispersed in the direction perpendicular to the array leads to an increase in reverberation in closed environments, such as theaters and auditoriums where PA systems are often installed in proximity to the walls. THE CHALLENGE Typical configuration of a live event in which a stereo PA system is mounted K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com THE SOLUTION This is where SAT comes in to save the day. In the initial developmental stages, the starting point was a sound baffle configuration. The natural energy dispersion of the acoustic baffle has a dipole characteristic or, in other words, a figure 8 dispersion. This seems to be a viable solution that can address the problem of minimizing the energy sent to the center stage, front stage and side walls. The drawback is that there is a strong emission in the rear of the system. In order to address this issue, the S.A.T. speakers have been mechanically designed to reduce and absorb sound emissions from the back panel. The resulting directivity does not manifest a figure 8, but looks more similar to a hyper-cardioid figure. This preserves the desired directivity and produces minimal back emissions. The following figure is a comparison of the horizontal dispersion of a standard 4-m long line array and a SAT system of the same length, consisting of 6 KH8 units per side. The use of the SAT system results in a reduction of sound pressure levels in the area occupied by the orchestra, at the front of the stage and on the side walls at an average of 12 dB in the medium-low range. Comparison of the energy distribution of a traditional PA system and a SAT system consisting of 6 KH8 units per side. The simulation shows the SPL values in a third octave band centered at 200 Hz. K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com The control of the directivity on the horizontal plane is not the only benefit of a diffuser devoid of a bulky box. Another advantage of SAT is a better impulse response than that of a conventional line array element. In truth, a direct-radiating bass reflex box uses a resonant air volume that tends to reduce the definition in the low-mid range and does not allow the correct reproduction of fast transients. Instead, SAT’s compact design allows sound to exit instantaneously without resonance, generating a significant amount of sound pressure in the low and low-mid range with a fast transient response. The hyper-cardioid dispersion in the low frequencies and an extremely fast impulse response are the true advantages of slim array speakers. The combination of these two factors leads to a significantly better acoustic outcome with respect to the traditional line array elements, particularly in terms of sound definition and noise pollution outside the desired audience areas. Additionally, the compactness of the speakers benefits the user through the practicality in transporting, the ease of assembly and the overall minimal footprint of the cluster which leads to an optimization of space, time and, therefore, total incurred costs for the management of these systems.

The stadium, home to Turkish Super League football team Beşiktaş JK Eagles, is also an entertainment and fashion center that hosts concerts and live shows, an interactive museum and the biggest sportswear store in Turkey. The Arena's sound system was also equipped with the most technologically advanced solutions on the market. Sound designer Stage Craft and distributor, Lotus Technologies, teamed up to provide 30 Mugello-KH5 loudspeakers and 12 Mugello-KS5 subwoofers to be suspended from the sides of the scoreboard. Equipped with Slim Array Technology, the KH5 allows sound to exit instantaneously without resonance, generating a significant amount of sound pressure in the low and low-mid range resulting in a better impulse response and maximum clarity and definition. The Electronic Beam Steering directs the sound to the audience area and provides continuous, even coverage that reaches the back row of the bleachers on the opposite side. The reconstruction of a historic and monumental stadium such as this one was a challenge altogether.

{"content": "Founded in 1892 in the town of Slemmestad, Norway, the Sekkefabrikken factory produced cement bags for the local manufacturing plant for almost 100 years until the plant shut down in 1989 and it was re-established as a concert venue and theater stage for the community. Organizers at Sekkefabrikken wanted to update their technical setup and after much consideration and fierce competition, the final choice landed on a Mugello system. Comprised of five Mugello-KH2 slim line array elements and two Mugello-KS5 subwoofers per side (including one backup each), the main system covers both the audience area in front of the stage and in the mezzanine above. Although the layout is similar to a walled pit, the sound is well balanced and evenly distributed throughout the audience area that accommodates 850-1000 guests. Two Python-KP102 speakers are mounted on each sidewall of the mezzanine as fill speakers, 6 meters of Anakonda-KAN200 as front fill and a total of six KF12 monitors, all powered by a Kommander-KA24 and a Kommander-KA84 amplifier. \"We quickly fell in love with the portability and power of our KR402 system upon arrival years ago, and this is the main the reason we wanted to consider a new system from K-array among the competing brands. The new system has really exceeded our expectations, especially with its extraordinary coverage of our audience area and we couldn’t be happier!\"", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/sekkefabrikken-concerts", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.684375"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "The Chicago outpost of nightclub and restaurant hybrid TAO is housed in a landmarked Romanesque Revival building in Chicago. Designed by Rockwell Group, the space’s aesthetics reflect the theme of existing TAO locations with Asian-inspired décor. The restaurant seats up to 300 diners and hosts a DJ booth while the 7,000-square-foot, 1,000-person capacity nightclub resides on the second floor and is equipped with two bars, a lounge area, dance floor and DJ booth. Rockwell’s go-to AV consultant Anthem Sound Stage and Lighting selected K-array to meet the many aesthetics, performance, reliability and sound quality requirements presented by the clients. A combination of Python-KP52 and Python-KP102 loudspeakers were integrated seamlessly in the main dining area paired with 6 Thunder-KMT18P 18” passive subwoofers driven by two Kommander-KA24 and two Kommander-KA84 amplifiers. Tornado-KT2C and Tornado-KT2 point sources were in abundance and installed throughout the room. The DJ booth in the restaurant was equipped with one Dragon-KX12 driven by one Thunder-KMT18 I sub. - Anthem suggested to use a live sound system that was less aggressive than the other TAO locations for a better experience for the clubgoers, but yet still maintained a powerful sound with high-definition and TAO was moreover impressed with the high performance from its compact design that integrated perfectly. For the main PA, 8 Firenze-KH7 loudspeakers were flown in each corner with 8 Dragon-KX12 point sources above the VIP tables. For the low end, 6 Mugello-KS5 subwoofers were dispersed around the room while 3 Firenze-KS8 subs were installed under the console at the DJ booth, which was equipped with 4 Dragon-KX12 units paired with 4 Thunder-KMT18 I subs. TAO's nightclub celebrated its opening weekend in late September with performances by several high-profile DJs, including DJ Ruckus and EDM superstar Deadmau5 leaving no room for error from the system. After a successful launch and continued satisfaction with the audio, the owners and Anthem are all happy with the system’s sound performance.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/tao-chicago", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.684382"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "The Hammock Festival is a two-day music festival featuring several genres like pop, rock, folk, rap and reggae, where attendees camp in tents or suspended hammocks in the wilderness of Gamlestølen park in Norway. The festival’s nine DJ sets took place in The Fusebox, the name given to the main stage in a 21 x 9m tent. Dinbestefest.no was brought on board to design and install both lighting and audio in just under five months so they quickly connected with distributor First Audio and designed a system comprised of two clusters of two Mugello-KH5 loudspeakers per side paired with six KS5 subwoofers - a first for an event in Norway. For DJ monitoring, a Axle-KRX402 system was implemented to give the artists all the sound they needed when the Mugello-KH5 system was in full use.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13971", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.684412"}, "embedding": null}

Integrated Electronic Brain STUNNING TO LOOK AT, PLEASING TO THE EAR, CHOSEN FOR RELIABILITY. “One of the most compact systems ever produced, with its elegant and discreet design.” Alex Tatini - CEO The material used for the construction of the K-array speakers is certainly a distinctive element that makes the K-array products unique, contributing both to the reduction of dimensions and to durability even in unfavorable weather conditions. Line array elements such as Kobra, Python and Kayman are in fact built with a partly handcrafted process of stainless steel sheet, skilfully cut, folded and welded with the utmost care. There is a long research project behind it, to minimize vibrations and unwanted resonances of the material. For the Kobra, Python and Kayman versions, the metal also has the possibility of being subjected to galvanic treatments for a more luxurious finishes such as 24k gold plating, or a processing of the raw material such as brushing or polishing. mirror that makes the product look camouflaged on the surface where it is located. The polishing in fact allows the product to be discreet, thanks to the play of reflection, of the same texture of which the background is composed.

The physical network connection allows remote control via Ethernet and enables the following physical network topologies: • Standard Star Topology - (Control only - Wi-Fi switched off) • Standard Star topology - Control and DANTE network (primary network without redundancy - Wi-Fi switched off). With a single wired Ethernet connection, both control and audio streams are integrated into the same network flow. IEB-Pro The IEB-Pro is equipped with a 2-port network switch featuring Ethernet connections (1 Gigabit / 1000 Mbps), but does not include Wi-Fi capability. The supported network topologies are as follows: • Star Network Topology - Control only - amplifiers in single- port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante sharing the same network (amplifiers in single-port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante Redundancy (amplifiers in single port mode - redundancy requires two fully separated networks); • Star Network Topology - with Control and Dante Splitted( amplifiers in single-port mode) - split requires two fully separated networks; • Daisy Chain Network with Control (amplifiers set in bridge- mode) - not recommended for DanteTM. For more information on Dante network topologies and primary/ secondary port configurations, please refer to the dedicated chapter on DANTE network.

Since every host on a network must be identified by a unique IP address, the simplest local network usually implements a router/switch with a DHCP server managing the addresses allocation: by default the Kommander‑KA unit is set to obtain a local IP address from the DHCP server. In case a DHCP server is not present on the LAN, the unit goes in Auto IP mode: in few seconds the amplifier automatically self- assigns an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16. A static IP address can be assigned to the amplifier unit using the amplifier’s embedded web app (Network menu). It is possible to connect to the amplifiers wired to the switch via a Wi-Fi access point and configure them using the K-Connect app on a mobile device. Please ensure that the access point is connected to the same local network (LAN) as the switch to allow communication between all devices. When amplifiers are connected to the network via Ethrnet cables, it is recommended to disable the amplifiers built-in Wi-Fi hot- spot.

Kommander-KA User Guide 20 Network topology and network requirements Single Network - Star Topology Control + Digital Audio Streaming A star network configuration for single network amplifiers allows both remote control and digital audio streaming to run over the same network, providing centralized management and high-quality audio distribution. This setup ensures reliable performance and optimal bandwidth allocation for complex audio systems. A. First connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration and using ETH1 port. B. The same network configuration is used to control the amplifiers and utilize the Digital Audio Stream simultaneously. Single Network - Daisy Chain Control ONLY Daisy chaining network amplifiers allows multiple devices to be connected in daisy chain using a single network cable, streamlining installation and minimizing the need for additional switches. This configuration is ideal for remote control of amplifiers in multi-zone systems; however, it is not recommended for transmitting digital audio streams, as it may restrict bandwidth and degrade signal quality. Connecting the First Amplifier: 3. Connect the EHT1 port of the first amplifier to an external switch or network source. 4. Set the first amplifier to bridge mode. 5. Connect the EHT2 port of the first amplifier to the EHT1 port of the second amplifier. 6. Continue this pattern, connecting the EHT2 port of each amplifier to the EHT1 port of the next amplifier. Kommander-KA+ The Kommander-KA+ are equipped with the IEB-Pro platform, which, as we have seen, includes a switch with 2 ports for Ethernet-wired connections but does not have built-in Wi-Fi. Therefore, the primary access and control methods must be through a local network connected with Ethernet cables to a dedicated switch. • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel. The managing control softwares are the embedded Web- app, K-monitor or K-framework. Network settings (with DanteTM) • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel • disable the ENABLE AUTOIP function in the network tab. • Avoid Daisy-Chain if working with DanteTM. (Audinate, the manufacturer, does not recommend daisy-chaining through more than two hops, as this can cause latency issues and potentially disrupt the audio stream.) See the DanteReadyTM paragraph to more details. Built-in Wi-Fi is not present on KA+ - direct Wi-Fi connection is not possible - connection via an access point on the same LAN is supported for K-Connect use.

By connecting the second network port of the amplifiers to a separate switch, a secondary or redundant network can be established, dedicated solely to the Dante™ audio streaming or other audio-over-IP protocols. This setup enhances system reliability and ensures uninterrupted audio performance. G. Connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration using ETH1 port. H. Connect each amplifier to a second switch via the EHT2 port. This setup creates a secondary or redundant network, ensuring a separate and reliable transmission path.

K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on- line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. K-framework3 allows to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available, or import from scratch in the workspace the real active loudspeakers and amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology.* The network shall comprise of: • single PC or MAC, running the K-framework3 software with network interface 100Mbps (or higher); • router with DHCP server 100Mbps (or higher); • Ethernet switch 100Mbps (or higher); • Cat5 (or higher) Ethernet cables. A DHCP server is highly recommended even if the device units implement the zeroconf network technologies: if a DHCP service is not available, every device will self assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16 (auto-IP). Discovery 1. Ensure that all the units and the PC/Mac running the K-framework3 are properly connected to the same network. 2. Power up the units. 3. Launch K-framework3. 4. Open the Network window and launch the discovery: • If K-framework3 finds two or more devices with the wrong ID, a dialog window appears where unique IDs can be assigned to the units. 5. Once discovered, the real units are shown in the left columns, following the order of their ID number; if the workspace contains virtual devices of the same type you can eventually modify the IDs in order to match the units and allows the synchronization. The synchronization can be in either directions: Workspace-to-Real or Real-to- Workspace. Select the sync direction and synchronize all or the single units separately 3D simulation In the 3D simulation mode of K-Framework 3, you can position systems and speakers at precise height and distance coordinates. The system then calculates sound emission and simulates sound pressure levels based on these coordinates and the defined dimensions of the listening area, allowing for accurate configuration and adjustment.

For the main dining area six Python-KP102 line array elements with 3” cone drivers, 8 half-meter Python-KP52 line arrays, 4 Thunder-KMT12P 12” passive subwoofers and two 21” Thunder-KMT21 subwoofers, one passive and one powered, were discreetly installed throughout the room and driven by a 4-channel 2000W Kommander-KA84 amplifier. Four Python-KP52 half-meter line array elements were setup at the sushi bar and driven by one Kommander-KA84 amplifier.

{"content": "NOI is the nouveau high-energy loung/bar located at the most high-end luxurious mall, The Chanakya, in Delhi with an inhouse DJ that transform the locale into a nightly hot spot. The client, real estate moguls DLF India, took the project to system integrator Macbee to produce the best sounding bar in Delhi, however, interior designer Rockwell Group USA required an absolutely discreet audio system without any acoustic treatment to not disturb the high-end interior concept. Another challenge was that the seating at the bar and in the courtyard is positioned very close to the walls so any surface installation could cause a poor experience for those close to the speakers rather than in the middle of the areas. With these requirements, Macbee wanted to take advantage of SPL consistency from a line array setup even though most bars and clubs in Delhi employ point sources. And the only product which could fit in their design and meet both demands was K-array with their small footprint and Pure Array Technology. For the bar, a system comprised of 4 Python-KP102 line arrays, 2 Thunder-KMT18P subs and 4 Rumble-KU212 subs were installed and powered by a Kommander-KA84 amplifier. 8 Python-KP102 line arrays, 2 Thunder-KMT18P subwoofers and 4 Rumble-KU212 subs powered by a Kommander-KA84 amp were installed in the double-height courtyard. 4 Python-KP52 loudspeakers paired with 2 Thunder-KMT12P subs powered by a Kommander-KA24 amp for the outdoor lounge. The speakers were placed in the corners and the subs were set behind the seating with two in the ceiling in the courtyard area, so they were completely hidden but yet able to give the low energy required for the weekends when there are around 500-600 people and the bar turns into a nightclub. We were able to achieve a very high seat-to-seat consistency in terms of smooth bass response as well as SPL. The most amazing response from the management was that they were able to sit right next to the speaker and still have a conversation. Not only were we able to just achieve - we exceeded the clients’ and designers’ expectations both in terms of performance and looks using K-array unique audio solutions.

{"content": "Moxy Times Square is the NY flagship of Marriott's new, experimental global brand and its edgier hotel alternative complete with 4 eateries, the largest all-season rooftop lounge in NYC and mini golf course. Full-service production and installation agency, Anthem Productions, was asked to design the audio systems for all main common areas – each with their own set of requirements – so they looked to K-array America for help. The systems had to sound amazing at low levels with the ability to play very loud since they all turn into a high energy party with the need to hold together at high volume levels. For the Legasea Restaurant & Bar, a system comprised of 14 Python-KP52 line arrays, 8 Tornado-KT2C point sources, 6 Thunder-KMT12P subwoofers and 5 Kommander-KA84 amplifiers was installed.

{"content": "Standard Dining Club – located in Campinas, one of the most vibrant gastro scene in São Paulo – is a combination of international cusine, beautiful interior design and modern technology to give its customers a sensorial experience through light, video and sound. Created by entrepreneurs André Morete and Paulo Anttogneto, the architects' scope of the 365-m² space is to harmonize natural elements, like slate and marble, with the most advanced visual tecnologies, like mapped projection, and sound reinforcement. Because of this unique concept, the biggest challenge at the Standard was to integrate a space capable to host live music and DJs performances without losing its architectonic sophistication. Even more, the parametric forms of the walls, the reserved space for mapped projection and the low celling made the positioning of speakers a big trouble, that, one more time, was solved thanks to Italian manufacturer K-ARRAY technology. To compose the main PA, distributors Gobos do Brasil used 4 Kobra-KK102 I speakers with 2 Thunder-KMT21P subwoofers driven by a Kommander-KA84 amplifier. At the restaurant/bar area, that demanded a more reserved atmosphere, the choice was 6 Kobra-KK52 unites with 2 Thunder-KMT12P subs driven by a Kommander-KA24. The Standard Dining Club's external balcony was covered using a Seizing the space characteristics, the option was for a creative system, and the choice was 8 Tornado-KTL2 speakers. Completing the bass, was installed 2 Rumble-KU44 powered by the Kommander-KA14. Thanks to this composition it was possible to preserve the architects and designers' vision and, at the same time, to provide a state-of-the-art sound experience to the venue. Instead of trying to hide the speakers, we did the opposite; positioning the slim and powerful Kobra systems on the walls inside the context of the mapped projection, receiving all the AV content. K-array is the only brand in the world to have products that are virtually invisible and extremely powerful with high quality at the same time. We were able to take this concept at its maximum, integrating the sound to the beautiful creations for the video mapping.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/standard-dining-club", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685146"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "Constructed by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Solomon Temple is a spectacular landmark in the city of São Paulo and is a replica of the First Temple built by Solomon built in the 5th century BC but with increased dimensions. Considered the largest religious building in Brazil, the mega-church seats 10,000 worshipers in its sanctuary and stands at 55 meters (180') tall, the height of an 18-story building. With an area of approximately 100,000 square meters, the 11-story complex includes the main sanctuary, 36 classrooms, radio and television studios, a museum about the original temple, 84 apartments of differing sizes for bishops and pastors of the church, a helicopter landing pad and a garden. Its rich design is detailed down to the use of very high technological means of communication, which are intended to be hidden from visitors’ eyes. In order to to maintain that standard along with reproducing the gospel with faithfulness, clarity and intelligibility, the church engineering team's choice was unanimous: K-array. In the sanctuary, the main PA consists of 42 Mugello-KH4 and 6 KO70 speakers installed 18 meters high in acoustic niches above the ceiling, hidden by perforated plates specially designed to not interfere with sound propagation. 24 Python-KP102 line arrays are used as sidefills at the altar. Stage monitoring was covered with 22 Python-KP102, 6 KA40, 2 Mugello-KH4, 2 Thunder-KMT18 and 2 Thunder-KMT18P for the celebrant bishops and pastors. The system used as the FOH reference monitor is 2 Kobra-KK50, 1 Rumble-KU36, 1 KA7-7 amp and a KF12MT. The outdoor main entrance is equipped with 6 Python-KP102, personalized in the same color of the stones from Israel and installed within the wall. They are driven by a KA40 amp. In the conference rooms, custom painted Turtle-KRM33P speakers have been positioned on the ceiling providing controlled horizontal dispersion and extended frequency response to broadcast the sermons around the building. Solomon's Temple is the first Temple in Brazil to achieve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification, an acknowledgement of the “green seal” enterprise. K-array’s compact and lightweight speakers have contributed greatly to the energy efficient features. Universal brought us a big challenge: to install a sound system in this huge area, using invisible, light and ecologically correct sound equipment. Large indoor places require a lot of caution and study, because they usually have big reverberation and acoustic reflections, making it difficult to understand the voice. We presented the architect and directors of the build a detailed study where our solution showed a high level of intelligibility and clarity, besides counting on a great SPL left.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/solomon-temple", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685196"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "PRESS RELEASE K-array’s Invisible Solutions Just Got More Discreet K-array’s Azimut is a complete audio solution in a miniature package composed of two 10cm-long Lyzard loudspeakers, an ultra-compact Rumble-KU44-2 subwoofer, a Kommander-KA02 amplifier and a covert remote control, Not only is this system the most discreet professional audio solution on the market, it was developed with the end user in mind. In addition to balanced analog inputs and fiber optical input, the Azimut boasts plug and play capabilities with Bluetooth connectivity, USB ports and mini jack input. Hundreds of thousands of songs are available to you through onboard Spotify and Web Radio streaming by connecting to the Azimut app over Wi-Fi. The app also provides the possibility to manage all the functions of the amplifier, from sound source selection and playlist management to graphic equalization and multi-room network setup. The mid-high speakers with four 0.5” transducers form ultra-micro line arrays that deliver long throw and homogeneous coverage with crystal clear audio. Housed in a durable and resistant aluminum enclosure, the four full-range, high-efficiency driver units have neodymium magnet structures and suspensions engineered for maximum linear excursion and minimum residual transducer noise. The two Lyzards produce an impressive SPL and have a very wide horizontal coverage for such a small form. However, when more coverage and power is needed the Azimut has modular capabilities and can expand by up to an additional six Lyzard loudspeakers. By combining the two Lyzards with the Rumble-KU44-2, the system creates full range frequency response with prodigious output and a virtually invisible profile. Only 10cm deep, the subwoofer provides an extremely powerful low-end that can be easily integrated in its surroundings, including furniture and walls. The Azimut system is equipped with a wired remote control that shares the same physical characteristics of a Lyzard loudspeaker for a homogenous look and allows volume control and Bluetooth management. A wireless controller option is available with an additional capability to manage playlists. And when more rooms are equipped with the Azimut system, a LAN network can be created to control them all at once by selecting one system as master and the others as slaves. Made of premium materials, the aluminum loudspeakers and stainless-steel sub make the system extremely resistant, even when deployed outside in tough weather conditions. They are impenetrable by foreign objects like dust, sand or water, which over time can damage an ordinary audio element. The Azimut is designed for discreet use in a variety of intimate environments, ideally retail where the system can easily integrate within the layout of the store without detracting from the visual PRESS RELEASE merchandising, display and store design which are vital to enhancing the look, image and accessibility of a store’s goods and services. Other suggested applications are restaurants, cafés and bars and museums. ∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙ K-array is a renowned manufacturer of innovative pro audio solutions with global headquarters in Florence, Italy.

To ensure proper operation, please carefully read the owner’s manuals and safety instruction before using the products. After reading this manual, be sure to keep it for future reference. Dante is a proprietary digital media networking solution, developed by Audinate and licensed by K-array, which allows to convey audio content over standard Ethernet networks using the Internet Protocol (Audio over IP). When a K-array device receives Dante audio packets, it reconstructs them back into a continuous digital audio stream, which is then played out. The Dante audio implementation is 100% lossless 24- or 32-bit PCM, 48 kHz sample rate. K-array devices incorporate Dante as an optional software implemented solution, giving the user to get immediate, no- fuss connectivity over IP on demand. Dante Ready Dante Ready allows the user to purchase and add audio channels to a K-array device after initial purchase with easy-to- use software, paying only for as many channels as are required. Dante Controller Dante Controller software allows the user to configure signal routes and other settings. All routes and settings are stored in the individual Dante devices, allowing them to run without any connected computers. Dante Ready Activator scans the local Dante network for any Dante Ready eligible products and shows the available options; purchases are immediately applied to the target devices for a smooth, easy experience.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13953", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685273"}, "embedding": null}

This entitles to use either a proper screw with 4 mm (0,16 in) max diameter, or a M5 bolt, according to the mounting surface. Follow the instructions for wall mounting the Vyper-KV52 loudspeaker without brackets; the procedure is the same for the Vyper-KV25. 1. Unscrew the M3x6mm screws that tighten the grill from the sides of the loudspeaker, using a Torx T10 screwdriver; 2. Gently remove the grill from the loudspeaker; 3. Use the proper screw and plug for mounting the loudspeaker on the surface; 4. Reposition the outer grill on the loudspeaker and tighten the screws. 4 mm max [0.16 in max] Vyper User Guide 8 Joining Multiple Vyper-KV52 The two included joining plates allow to join two Vyper-KV52 units together to create a longer array. Use four M3x6mm screws included in one package to join the two speakers. The remaining M3x6mm screws from the second loudspeaker package can be used for wall mounting the array with a couple of brackets. More than two units can be joined together in order to obtain long line array. For setting the signal routing between the arrayed loudspeakers, please refer to the paragraph Connecting Multiple Vyper-KV52, p. 9. Vyper User Guide 9 Connecting The Vyper-KV25 and Vyper-KV52 feature euroblock 2 pin Phoenix inlet for easy connectivity and link. Caution must be taken when connecting the loudspeaker cable to the flying connector to match the signal polarity: + HOT red wire – COLD black/blue wire If a label with signal polarity is not present on the flying connector, please refer to the label on the loudspeaker rear panel. For a cable run of up to 5 m (16.4 ft) use wire gauge of 0,75 mm2 (18 AWG) at least. For longer cable runs a wider gauge is recommended. For the Vyper-KV52, the input signal can be fed either in the top or in the bottom input connector. Vyper-KV25 Low: 8 Ω High: 32 Ω Vyper-KV52 Low: 16 Ω High: 64 Ω Connecting Multiple Vyper-KV52 The top and the bottom connectors of the Vyper-KV52 are paralleled so that the input signal can pass through the loudspeaker to fed another Vyper-KV52. A proper jumper wire must be prepared to fed the signal in the loudspeaker joined in line array configuration (see Joining Multiple Vyper-KV52). Joining the loudspeakers set them in parallel (see paragraph Loudspeakers in Parallel, p. 10). Impedance Settings Both the Vyper-KV25 and the Vyper-KV52 feature selectable impedance. Selecting the proper impedance allows the loudspeaker to match the amplifier requirements, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel (see paragraph Loudspeakers in Parallel, p. 10). A switch on the rear panel toggles the loudspeaker’s load impedance between two values. 6 mm (0.23 in) Jumper wire 25 mm (1 in) 12 mm (0.5 in) 6 mm (0.25 in) Vyper User Guide 10 2+ 1+ 1- 2- 12 mm (0.5 in) 1+ 2- 1- 2+ 25 mm (1 in) Connecting the Amplifier K-array’s Kommander line of amplifiers featuring built-in DSP will operate the Vyper-KV25 and Vyper-KV52 at their optimized performance only with the proper preset. Load the device preset according to the connected loudspeaker before applying any signal to the unit. Set the dedicated Vyper-KV25 / Vyper-KV52 DEVICE PRESET on the amplifier DSP BEFORE applying any signal to the loudspeaker Before connecting the loudspeaker cable to the amplifier: • ensure the loudspeaker impedance matches the amplifier channel rated loading impedance, especially when connecting multiple loudspeakers in parallel (see next paragraph); • ensure that the amplifier is switched off. When connecting the wires to a SpeakOn NL4 connector, screw the HOT+ wire to the terminal 1+ or 2+ and the COLD– wire to the terminal 1- or 2-. Loudspeakers in Parallel By connecting the loudspeakers in parallel it is possible to drive many loudspeakers with the same audio signal by means of a single amplifier output channel. The parallel connection lowers the total load impedance. Caution must be taken to maintain the load impedance of the paralleled loudspeakers above the amplifier’s minimum loading impedance. Use the table below to match the number of loudspeakers at the specified impedance that can be connected to K-array’s Kommander amplifiers.

Dante is a proprietary digital media networking solution, developed by Audinate and licensed by K-array, which allows to convey audio content over standard Ethernet networks using the Internet Protocol (Audio over IP). When a K-array device receives Dante audio packets, it reconstructs them back into a continuous digital audio stream, which is then played out. The Dante audio implementation is 100% lossless 24- or 32-bit PCM, 48 kHz sample rate. K-array devices incorporate Dante as an optional software implemented solution, giving the user to get immediate, no- fuss connectivity over IP on demand. Dante Ready Dante Ready allows the user to purchase and add audio channels to a K-array device after initial purchase with easy-to- use software, paying only for as many channels as are required. Dante Controller Dante Controller software allows the user to configure signal routes and other settings. All routes and settings are stored in the individual Dante devices, allowing them to run without any connected computers. Dante Ready Activator scans the local Dante network for any Dante Ready eligible products and shows the available options; purchases are immediately applied to the target devices for a smooth, easy experience. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, Dante Controller must be updated to version 4.5.0.9 or later (February 2022) which includes Dante Ready Activator.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13950", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685415"}, "embedding": null}

PRODUCT PHYSICAL OVERVIEW 13,8in 351,3mm 17,7in 450mm 20,9in 530mm Weight KM112: 23.0 kg (50.7 lbs) KM112P: 17.0 kg (37.5 lbs) KM112 - KM112P Ver. 1.1 9 6. HORN ORIENTATION The KM112 features a 12” coaxial transducer coupled to an asymmetric horn. Because the horn is asymmetric, its sound dispersion pattern is different in respect to its axes: 100° x 30°. The horn can be manually rotated 90° thanks to the red guide that rotates the horn from a 100° horizontal coverage (Wide) to a 30° horizontal coverage (Narrow). WIDE 100° horizontal - 30° vertical NARROW 30° horizontal - 100° vertical KM112 - KM112P Ver. 1.1 10 7.1 AC POWER The amplifier module and any audio equipment connected to it (mixing consoles, processors, etc.) must be properly connected to the AC power distribution, preserving AC line polarity. Every grounding point must be connected to a single node or common point using the same cable gauge as the neutral and line cable. Bad grounding connections between speakers and the rest of the equipment may produce noise, hum or serious damage to the input/output stages in the system’s electronic equipment. Before applying AC to any K-array self-powered speaker, be sure that the voltage potential difference between neutral and earth ground is less than 5 VAC. 7. KM112 AMPLIFIER PANEL 7.2 VOLTAGE REQUIREMENT The amplifier’s auto-range power supply feature allows the amp unit to operate safely and with no audio discontinuity when the AC voltage stays within a nominal range of 100 - 240 V (operating range 85 - 265 V) at 50 to 60 Hz. Please verify that your AC main connections are capable of satisfying the power rating for the device. CAUTION. Do not connect the system to AC power mains exceeding 265 V. Doing so will cause significant damage to the device and create serious risk for users! 7.3 CURRENT REQUIREMENT The amplifier presents a dynamic load to the AC mains, drawing additional current as operating levels increase. Different cables and circuit breakers heat up at varying rates, so it is essential to understand current ratings and how they correspond to circuit breaker and cable specifications. Maximum continuous RMS current - measured over a period of at least ten seconds - is used to calculate the temperature increase in cables, which drives the proper size and gauge cable and rating for slow-reacting thermal breakers. Maximum burst RMS current - measured over a period of approximately one second - is used to select the rating for fast reacting magnetic breakers. For best performance, voltage drops should not exceed 10% at 100 V or 10% at 230 V. The minimum electrical service amperage required by a K-array loudspeakers system is the sum of their maximum continuous RMS current. K-array recommends allowing an additional 30% above the minimum amperage to prevent peak voltage drops at the service entry. KM112 - KM112P Ver. 1.1 11 7.4 PROTECTION CIRCUITRY Both the Power supply and the amplifier sections are equipped with several protection circuits. Power supply protections aim to isolate a faulty section in electrical power system from the rest of the device in order to prevent the propagation of the fault and limit device damages. They comprise overcurrent, overvoltage and thermal protections. Amplifier protections are triggered by audio signal current and voltage – by comparing input and output – and NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors. A Peak Current Shut Down and a Temperature Protection Limiter protect the output stage. High frequency stationary signals, like steady sinusoidal signals – improperly referred as continuous or permanent signals – with high amplitude tend to stress the amplifier section of the modules as well as the loudspeakers voice coils. When a high frequency stationary loud signal is feed into the amplifier a dedicated Limiter limits its mean current depending on its level and frequency.

{"content": "BASE Creative Hub is a collaboration between a public state-owned building entrusted by the Municipality of Milan and a private self-financed, non-profit company to offer 12,000 square meters of exhibition space, shows, concerts, workshops, conferences, study rooms and artist residences. Emanuele Calorio, music production manager, needed to equip the large area referred to as Spazio B with a sound system suitable for both live shows and the numerous conferences held in BASE Milan. He also required a system that is so versatile, it can also be used for film projections with Dolby Digital audio. Based on these needs, Calorio selected the Dragon-KX12 as it is able to provide all the power and fidelity needed for a live musical show, but also the uniform coverage and perfect speech intelligibility necessary to make a conference for hundreds of listeners. In addition to the main system, which consists of four Dragon-KX12 loudspeakers paired with two Thunder-KMT21 subs, additional Dragons have been distributed along the length of the room and mounted on brackets to adapt it to the different options for using the audio system. Another Dragon is installed as front-fill above the stage in the center, and pointed towards the front rows of the audience. A pair of new Mastiff-KM112 stage monitors are available onstage for performances. Space B also includes a large area that flanks the main hall and to also adequately cover this space, three Kobra-KK102 are angled appropriately and delayed. The minimal design of the speakers, allows us to have equal coverage and pressure, and practically disappears within space, as often required for installations of an design nature. We were able to install the whole system in record time and we were able to use it to full satisfaction for a great music festival and meeting that BASE Milano hosted within the Milan Music Week.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/base-milano", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685521"}, "embedding": null}

PRODUCT PHYSICAL OVERVIEW 20,9in 530mm 32,3in 820mm 13,8in 351,5mm 13,2in 335,5mm Weight KM112: 37.5 kg (82.7 lbs) KM112P: 33.5 kg (73.9 lbs) KM312 - KM312P Ver. 1.1 9 6. HORN ORIENTATION The central 12” coaxial transducer is coupled to an asymmetric horn. Because the horn is asymmetric, its sound dispersion pattern is different in respect to its axes: 100° x 30°. The horn can be manually rotated 90° thanks to the red guide that rotates the horn from a 100° horizontal coverage (Wide) to a 30° horizontal coverage (Narrow). WIDE 100° horizontal - 30° vertical NARROW 30° horizontal - 100° vertical KM312 - KM312P Ver. 1.1 10 7.1 AC POWER The amplifier module and any audio equipment connected to it (mixing consoles, processors, etc.) must be properly connected to the AC power distribution, preserving AC line polarity. Every grounding point must be connected to a single node or common point using the same cable gauge as the neutral and line cable. Bad grounding connections between speakers and the rest of the equipment may produce noise, hum or serious damage to the input/output stages in the system’s electronic equipment. Before applying AC to any K-array self-powered speaker, be sure that the voltage potential difference between neutral and earth ground is less than 5 VAC. 7. KM312 AMPLIFIER PANEL 7.2 VOLTAGE REQUIREMENT The amplifier’s auto-range power supply feature allows the amp unit to operate safely and with no audio discontinuity when the AC voltage stays within a nominal range of 100 - 240 V (operating range 85 - 265 V) at 50 to 60 Hz. Please verify that your AC main connections are capable of satisfying the power rating for the device. CAUTION. Do not connect the system to AC power mains exceeding 265 V. Doing so will cause significant damage to the device and create serious risk for users! 7.3 CURRENT REQUIREMENT The amplifier presents a dynamic load to the AC mains, drawing additional current as operating levels increase. Different cables and circuit breakers heat up at varying rates, so it is essential to understand current ratings and how they correspond to circuit breaker and cable specifications. Maximum continuous RMS current - measured over a period of at least ten seconds - is used to calculate the temperature increase in cables, which drives the proper size and gauge cable and rating for slow-reacting thermal breakers. Maximum burst RMS current - measured over a period of approximately one second - is used to select the rating for fast reacting magnetic breakers. For best performance, voltage drops should not exceed 10% at 100 V or 10% at 230 V. The minimum electrical service amperage required by a K-array loudspeakers system is the sum of their maximum continuous RMS current. K-array recommends allowing an additional 30% above the minimum amperage to prevent peak voltage drops at the service entry. KM312 - KM312P Ver. 1.1 11 7.4 PROTECTION CIRCUITRY Both the Power supply and the amplifier sections are equipped with several protection circuits. Power supply protections aim to isolate a faulty section in electrical power system from the rest of the device in order to prevent the propagation of the fault and limit device damages. They comprise overcurrent, overvoltage and thermal protections. Amplifier protections are triggered by audio signal current and voltage – by comparing input and output – and NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors. A Peak Current Shut Down and a Temperature Protection Limiter protect the output stage. High frequency stationary signals, like steady sinusoidal signals – improperly referred as continuous or permanent signals – with high amplitude tend to stress the amplifier section of the modules as well as the loudspeakers voice coils. When a high frequency stationary loud signal is feed into the amplifier a dedicated Limiter limits its mean current depending on its level and frequency.

{"content": "The General Assembly of the Councils of Chartered Accountants and Accountants' Orders is an annual meeting for members of the association to discuss relevant sector topics. The event is organized in two sessions with the first session of the 2017 edition moderated by famed Italian journalist Franco Di Mare, and included a report by the national president of the category, Massimo Miani, who addressed issues related to fiscal and categorical current affairs. The second session in the afternoon was dedicated to the internal debate between the National Council and the delegates with interventions of the political and institutional authorities. The convention is held at the La Nuvola in Roma which is a spacious 8,000-seat convention center designed by Massimiliano Fuksas, with 30 meeting rooms. The scenic heart of the project, is the Auditorium which seats 1,750. Rental company Planet Service was responsible for providing the AV of the convention and decided upon a powerful Firenze-KH7 system for its short rigging time, its Electronic Beam Steering capabilities that allowed them to cover the entire auditorium with even sound without having to bend the line array. The system is also self-powered which eliminated the need for additional amplifiers to drive the system and maintained a clean look since no additional cables were required. The main PA consisted of a cluster of 3 vertical hanging Firenze-KH7 line arrays per side. The front fill was comprised of 16 Kobra-KK102 arranged horizontally along the edge of the stage to create a long line array with pure array characteristics meaning that is very narrow on the horizontal plane and very wide on the vertical plane. The Kobras were paired with 4 Thunder-KMT18 subwoofers per side to provide the low frequencies and drive the front fill.

{"content": "Held in May this year, Suara’s independent art, music, culture and educational festival is set on the pristine Tabanan coast on the Indonesian island of Bali. Founded for the good of its community, the unique two-day event has a clear mission to bring together locals and visitors to connect and celebrate the beauty of Balinese heritage and nature. Now in its second year, the location for Suara is Nuanu City, ‘a home for visionaries and creators’. With aspirations to establish itself as a ‘smart city’, Nuanu’s future-facing community embraces a forward-thinking, sustainable mindset, with cultural centres, theatres and other activities all tied to the world of technology, culture and well-being. The festival itself welcomed around 4,000 visitors daily who could enjoy a packed schedule of workshops, cultural activities and performances across nine unique stages. An outdoor festival requires high-performance, flexible and discreet loudspeakers and when it came to choosing the supplier for Suara, K-array was the ‘first choice’ for Suara Producer Alexander Solonin and Sound Engineer Semen Chumanikhin:“We had heard the power of K-array’s flexible Anakonda line array system and Thunder-KS2 subwoofer at Nuanu recording studio, which sounded truly amazing, so we were confident in choosing K-array loudspeakers on the Garuda and Seaside stages.” The festival boasts an enviable line-up of speakers and workshops but for many festival-goers, music is the highlight of the two-day extravaganza. This year saw some of Indonesia’s best talent perform on the site’s nine specially constructed zones and stages. The Garuda main stage is a stunning bamboo structure, and hosted music from various headlining acts including Balinese musical legends Joni Agung and The Double T and local favourite Catur & The Sound Nomads as well as international reggae band, Big Mountain, best known for its iconic track ‘Baby, I Love Your Way.’ The largest amphitheatre in Bali, the Garuda was the ideal setting for K-array’s unique flexible cluster array with an audio configuration comprising six Firenze-KH7 compact loudspeakers stacked both horizontally and vertically, and seven KS8 touring systems in an arc formation. The second ‘Seaside’ stage is perched on the clifftop overlooking Nyanyi Beach and provided a picturesque setting for a variety of Balinese performances and inspirational thought leaders. At sunset the stage transformed into a dance party featuring some of Bali’s favourite DJs, with another cleverly designed K-array system configuration using three Firenze-KS7s with two KH8s and four Mastiff-KM112 compact monitors. As well as live music performances, workshops and events, Suara hosted a series of large-scale art installations, with world-class 3D projection mapping designed by the multimedia production company ‘Collab’. Ukrainian sculptor, Alexander Milov’s vast stainless-steel structure, \"The Birth of a New World\" - represented by a ‘mother goddess’ – debuted at the festival, illuminated by lasers and LED lights, while 3D projections constantly shifted on two giant intergalactic faces, designed by South African artist Daniel Popper. Both installations were brought to life with K-array audio in a configuration comprised of 16 Firenze-KH7s with 12 KS8s, connected to create a longer cluster, 4 Kayman passive line array speakers and 4 Thunder-KS4P ultra-light, high-power subwoofers.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/suara-festival-bali", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685594"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "Claudio Baglioni is an Italian pop singer-songwriter and musician whose success spans over several decades as his melodic and highly-dramatic love ballads are part of Italy's musical and national subculture. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of his storied career, Baglioni has set out on a national arena tour selling out shows from Rome to Turin, along the way impressing audiences with solid performances and outstanding audio in the form of a Firenze-KH7 touring system. THE TEAM Rental company: Agorà FOH: Maurizio Nicotra Monitor engineer: Remo Scafati PA manager: Edoardo Michelori Sound designer/engineer: Daniele Tramontani Live sound product specialist: Klaus Hausherr Product specialist: Danilo Amato THE CHALLENGE Given the artist’s penchant for a central stage setup, rental company Agorà had the difficult task of equipping the Al Centro tour with the best sound system that allowed for an impeccable mix in a 360° configuration as well as one that was as less invasive as possible to not obstruct the audience’s view in the four-corner setup. The choice of loudspeaker began with Baglioni’s requirement for a small footprint. With a compact design that allows sound to exit instantaneously without resonance yet generates a significant amount of sound pressure in the low and low-mid range resulting in a better impulse response and maximum clarity and definition, K-array became the benchmark straightaway. THE SOLUTION 360° Main PA: 8 clusters x 5 Firenze-KH7 (two per corner) enter fill: 4 clusters x 2 Firenze-KH7 Subwoofers: 4 suspended lines x 6 Firenze-KS7 in electronic arc configuration Side front fill: 8 line arrays x 2 Kayman-KY102 Center front fill: 4 line arrays x 1 Kayman-KY102 THE SET UP ADVANTAGES Hyper-cardioid dispersion pattern: In the low end, the KH7 shows a hyper cardioid dispersion pattern in the horizontal plane thanks to its Slim Array Technology, minimizing the amount of energy sent to the center of the stage keeping it clear of noise pollution for the performers. Super low-profile: Compact frame that is perfect for a 360° configuration Lightweight: Each cluster is less than 300 kg, including amplification and processing Easy to mount: Produces remarkably quick setup times. Together with lighting and video technicians, Agorà is able to have the system ready in just over 6 hours, while the dismantling is done in under three hours. Flown straight: “Compared to traditional PAs, a significant advantage in using the KH7 is the fact that it can be flown straight and we don’t have to set up angles from the ground,” says Michelori. “In fact, as soon as we see a motor point ready, we attack the system without having to ask anything from anyone.” Flexibility: At the artist's request, the front fill had to be flexible due to different spacing at the various venues. This Kayman setup gives the front fill a wide opening angle and by arranging the three column systems, the entire side is covered. The decision to suspend the subwoofers was necessary to free the stage from barriers. The team was concerned that raising the drivers would result in a loss of power but because the system doesn’t lack power, all apprehensions were quickly subsided. “The lower end is extremely complex to manage, just as much as the high-end frequencies,” says Tramontani. We created a ring of 24 subs whose angles have been delayed, forming a circle. Looking from within on the stage though, the graph of the dispersion behaves as if it were a flower with the petals with the maximum cancellation right at the center of the stage.” THE RESULTS Despite all the delicate challenges the tour presented, the artist’s outstanding performances ascertained that combination of K-array’s unique loudspeakers and innovative technology with Agora’s professionalism was the perfect solution. The Firenze system is effective and capable of reproducing a high intelligibility along with a well-calibrated and homogeneous sound. Thanks to the system’s Electronic Beam Steering technology, the team was able to achieve a uniform coverage usually within +-3dB, even in the biggest arenas where the distance from the stage to the last seat is more than 50 m. I have to say that the system has exceeded expectations especially in a 360°, a configuration that is very difficult to implement because one side plays towards you while 3 others play against you and arrive delayed, slaughtering the response in phase. This system is designed to handle this setup very well with an adequate acoustic impact and high intelligibility, which is not always possible with other systems where compressions are often used to find the right punch.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/claudio-baglioni-tour", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685619"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "The Harvest Christian Fellowship Church in Riverside, California, recently installed a K-array audio system to enhance its outdoor amphitheatre’s sound quality. The church wanted to upgrade its previous 24-year-old point system to create a sound experience that could support various events, from Sunday services to seasonal celebrations. Working with system engineer Brian Bauer, the church narrowed down options before reaching out to Evan Hamilton at E2i Design for guidance. Together, they identified the K-array Firenze-KH7 system as the ideal solution. “Given the awkward layout of our courtyard, we realised that a standard line array would not meet our needs,” said Bryan Goode, production supervisor at Harvest Christian Fellowship. “Our former system engineer, Brian Bauer, suggested considering a column array instead. After conducting some research on the K-array KH7 column array, we reached out to E2I for assistance with the design and installation of the new system.” The setup includes five Firenze-KH7 speakers with Electronic Beam Steering (EBS) and two Firenze-KS7 subwoofers with advanced bass control. The Firenze system was chosen for its ability to provide consistent, immersive sound across expansive outdoor spaces, with independent control of each array element to minimise noise pollution and ensure continuous and even coverage throughout the amphitheatre. With its compact housing, the system has been designed to deliver instant sound projection without resonance, making it particularly suited to the open-air environment. Furthermore, the KH7 solution has been designed to withstand harsh outdoor elements. “After using the new system for our first Sunday morning service, everyone was amazed at how good it sounded and the clarity it provided,” commented Goode. “Our admin team was very happy with the outcome of the new system and thrilled with its performance. I am excited about the various events where we will be using this sound system. We have a wide range of activities, including Sunday Morning services, worship nights, movie screenings, our annual tree lighting, as well as Christmas and Easter celebrations. This sound system will meet all our needs perfectly.\"", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/harvest-christian-fellowship-church", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685629"}, "embedding": null}

After experiencing the usual challenges that most rental companies faced of high costs associated with loading time and transporting heavy speakers, the company founders set out to develop a better way of operating. Their results were revolutionary and, quite literally, out-of-the-box designs. The KH4 was developed to overcome these problems with over 4,000 W of onboard power, yet weighing around 100lbs and measuring only 6” deep. It was the first slim array technology speaker. Quick to assemble and deploy, easy to transport and delivering extremely high SPL with unprecedented quality for a wide variety of performance types and venue configurations, the flagship series helped establish K-array as a manufacturer of innovative pro audio solutions. Since then, K-array has maintained its reputation in the industry for revolutionary design by developing the next generation of touring systems – the Concert Series – and the top-of-the-line Firenze Systems, which include K-array’s distinctive Slim Array Technology (SAT). Just by looking at their compact profile, it’s apparent that SAT-featured products, such as the KH2, KH3, KH5, KH7 and KH8, are lightweight solutions which save space along with transportation costs, but users of the systems also enjoy little effort and time in setup and takedown and minimal visual impact on the venue. The practicality of transporting, the ease of assembly and the overall minimal footprint of the cluster are some of the advantages offered by SAT technology.. While these are significant benefits, the main advantage of SAT is that the compact design allows for a better impulse response with respect to a diffuser with a voluminous box and controls the horizontal directivity even at medium-low frequencies where traditional line arrays elements tend to be nearly omni-directional. K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com The figure below shows a typical configuration of a live event in which a stereo PA system is mounted. As mentioned, traditional line arrays have a low directivity on the horizontal plane below a certain frequency. The angle of the horizontal coverage, often greater than 180°, is very broad in the low frequency. Consequently, a large amount of energy is sent to center stage, the area where the orchestra is located, the front of the stage and towards the side walls. This results in numerous complications: • The emission of low frequency energy on the stage calls for an increased volume level of the monitors for the musicians, which consequently deteriorates the signal-to-noise ratio of the microphones and increases the difficulty in feedback management. • Similarly, the excess energy in the medium-low frequencies in the front rows leads to the need for very powerful front fill systems to ensure sufficient definition. Front fill systems driven at very high volumes worsen the definition of the sound on stage and further complicate the microphone placement. • The large amount of energy directed towards the center stage creates a big problem when there is an orchestra. The amount of gain available before triggering the feedback is greatly reduced, making it difficult to pickup the sound of instruments like the strings and piano. • The energy dispersed in the direction perpendicular to the array leads to an increase in reverberation in closed environments, such as theaters and auditoriums where PA systems are often installed in proximity to the walls. THE CHALLENGE Typical configuration of a live event in which a stereo PA system is mounted K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com THE SOLUTION This is where SAT comes in to save the day. In the initial developmental stages, the starting point was a sound baffle configuration. The natural energy dispersion of the acoustic baffle has a dipole characteristic or, in other words, a figure 8 dispersion. This seems to be a viable solution that can address the problem of minimizing the energy sent to the center stage, front stage and side walls. The drawback is that there is a strong emission in the rear of the system. In order to address this issue, the S.A.T. speakers have been mechanically designed to reduce and absorb sound emissions from the back panel. The resulting directivity does not manifest a figure 8, but looks more similar to a hyper-cardioid figure. This preserves the desired directivity and produces minimal back emissions. The following figure is a comparison of the horizontal dispersion of a standard 4-m long line array and a SAT system of the same length, consisting of 6 KH8 units per side. The use of the SAT system results in a reduction of sound pressure levels in the area occupied by the orchestra, at the front of the stage and on the side walls at an average of 12 dB in the medium-low range. Comparison of the energy distribution of a traditional PA system and a SAT system consisting of 6 KH8 units per side. The simulation shows the SPL values in a third octave band centered at 200 Hz. K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com The control of the directivity on the horizontal plane is not the only benefit of a diffuser devoid of a bulky box. Another advantage of SAT is a better impulse response than that of a conventional line array element. In truth, a direct-radiating bass reflex box uses a resonant air volume that tends to reduce the definition in the low-mid range and does not allow the correct reproduction of fast transients. Instead, SAT’s compact design allows sound to exit instantaneously without resonance, generating a significant amount of sound pressure in the low and low-mid range with a fast transient response. The hyper-cardioid dispersion in the low frequencies and an extremely fast impulse response are the true advantages of slim array speakers. The combination of these two factors leads to a significantly better acoustic outcome with respect to the traditional line array elements, particularly in terms of sound definition and noise pollution outside the desired audience areas. Additionally, the compactness of the speakers benefits the user through the practicality in transporting, the ease of assembly and the overall minimal footprint of the cluster which leads to an optimization of space, time and, therefore, total incurred costs for the management of these systems.

{"content": "K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com An Introduction to Electronic Beam Steering The line array’s introduction to the professional audio market in the 90s signaled a revolution for both live concert applications and installations. With a high directivity on the vertical plane, the line array’s sound beam can be focused on the audience area, ensuring greater intelligibility in highly reverberant environments and enabling uniform coverage of distances much greater than those attainable with traditional sources. Given this high directivity, the position of the cluster and the orientation of the individual speakers of which it is comprised are extremely critical parameters. In most applications, it is necessary to adjust the angles of an array in order to obtain the typical “banana” profile to direct the sound beam down towards the audience area. An error in the height of the cluster or the angles between the various units may significantly affect the quality of the sound on the audience area. Moreover, once the array is installed, it is no longer possible to modify the characteristics of the dispersion. It is here that the idea to digitally steer the sound beam generated by a line array was concieved. Imagine a number of sound sources all driven by the same signal. At any point within the space, the acoustic waves emitted by each source will interfere constructively or destructively, depending on the phase difference at that point. The interaction’s intensity, whether constructive or destructive, depends on the difference of the waves’ amplitude. Therefore, if each source’s signal phase and amplitude is controlled, it is possible to chose at which points we want the waves to sum and at which points we want the waves to cancel out each other. In other words, we can concentrate the sound energy in the space where it is needed, excluding areas that do not need to be affected by the sound beam. Signal K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com While this concept, identified as Electronic Beam Steering, might seem simple, it is actually very complex given that in space there are an infinite number of points where the waves interfere. In addition, the entire process is frequency dependent. Therefore, to obtain optimal results, it is necessary to manipulate each source’s signal with a very high frequency resolution. Electronic Beam Steering was initially implemented using the delay to vary the phase of the acoustic waves emitted by each line array element. The limitation of this approach is that the delay introduces a uniform delay at all frequencies and, therefore, does not allow the sound beam to be shaped independently at each frequency. This latter aspect is fundamental since the interaction between the acoustic waves emitted by each array element is a process that strongly depends on the frequency. Only by finely adjusting the phase and the amplitude of the signal frequency-by-frequency is it possible to obtain results of optimum steering, ensuring the same frequency response throughout the audience areas affected by the sound beam. This is possible only if FIR filters are used instead of the delay or traditional filters. The FIR filters (Finite Impulse Response) digital filters are characterized by the fact that their impulse response has a finite duration. Because they are digital filters, the input and output signals are sequences of discrete values, called samples. Each sample x that enters the filter is multiplied by a given coefficient b and added to the previous M Samples entered in the filter each multiplied by an appropriate coefficient. In other words, the value y[n] of the sample outgoing from the filter at the time n is the weighted average of the last M samples entered in the filter. One of the properties that makes these filters ideal for electronic beam steering is that they can alter the signal phase at a given frequency without altering the amplitude, and vice versa. If we consider that each FIR filter has hundreds of adjustable coefficients, it is not hard to believe that using them will allow you to manipulate the amplitude and phase of a signal with an extremely accurate frequency resolution. Obviously, the calculation of the FIR coefficients is not done by hand, but rather by a powerful software that has the responsibility of optimizing these values to obtain the desired acoustic result. The values of the coefficients can be selected to obtain the desired transfer function, which can be that of a simple traditional filter (low pass, high pass, shelving etc.) or even much more complex. FIR transfer function example For example, imagine a line array consisting of six KH2 elements each driven by a signal filtered by a FIR characterized by 400 coefficients. The software will have 6 x 400 = 2400 adjustable coefficients to ensure that the acoustic waves emitted by each line array element will interfere constructively in the audience area and interfere destructively where the sound pressure must be at a minimum i.e., the stage. Thanks to the very high number of coefficients in play, this steering process can be optimized frequency by frequency, ensuring optimal coverage throughout the entire audience area and reducing the noise pollution outside of this field. The following examples demonstrate how this technology allows the end user to have full sound beam control, achieving results which are unattainable using the traditional approach to electronic beam steering.

The simulations performed by the software are based on measured data at a very high resolution and are, therefore, totally representative of the actual behavior of the speaker. In the following images it is possible to see a plan view and a sectional view of an amphitheater where an audio system consisting of two clusters of 3 KH5 speakers is installed. The speakers are placed on the stage and oriented appropriately to ensure optimal coverage of entire audience area. The figures in the next pages demonstrate the simulation of the direct SPL in one octave band centered at 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz. 3 x KH5 units stacked Plan view and sectional view of an amphitheater where two clusters of 3 KH5 are installed 1000 Hz Electronic Beam Steering bypassed Electronic Beam Steering active K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com K-array srl unipersonale Via Paolina Romagnoli 17, 50038 Scarperia e San Piero, Firenze - Italy Tel. +39 (0)55 8487222 - info@k-array.com 2000 Hz Electronic Beam Steering bypassed Electronic Beam Steering active It is clear from the images that the activation of electronic beam steering leads to a clear improvement in the sound coverage of the audience area. The optimization of the FIR filter coefficients redistributes the energy so that, rather than being focused on the section closest to the system, it is distributed evenly over all areas of interest. The most interesting thing to note is that the intervention of electronic beam steering on the sound energy dispersion is very different in the two bands taken into consideration. At 1000 Hz, the sound beam is not parallel to the audience area resulting in a higher sound pressure build up in the front rows compared to the section farther from the system. Since they are no longer on the same axis of the sound beam, the first rows lose the energy surplus that was there before the FIR filters were applied. The digital optimization, therefore, tends to bend the beam upwards, so as to effectively redistribute the energy. Instead, at 2000 Hz the sound beam is already oriented in the right direction, so it does not need to be digitally bent. Rather, the digital optimization tends to reduce the angle of the vertical coverage so that the beam is better focused and can reach the back section of the audience with sufficient intensity. As explained above, only the use of FIR filters with a high number of coefficients can optimize the dispersion of the sound energy independently at each frequency. The application of a simple delay would not obtain the results shown in these examples. EXAMPLE 2 In the second example, two clusters comprised of three KH5 units are installed in the same amphitheater, but in a more extreme configuration. The clusters are suspended and left completely straight without any angle between the cabinets.

The sound energy is redistributed evenly rather than building up along the array’s axis. In many applications where there are restrictions on the cluster placement, the ability to effectively cover the audience area without having to utilize the typical banana profile is big advantage of the system CONCLUSION The ability to digitally adjust the dispersion of a line array element not only ensures the same listening experience to all audience members but, at the same time, limits the noise pollution in the areas where the sound pressure must be kept at a minimum. The use of FIR filters is the biggest advantage of our electronic beam steering technology since it provides extremely high frequency resolutions, which would not be possible using delays and traditional filters. Electronic beam steering is an important component of K-array’s Concert Series and Firenze Systems and, along with other important features such as premium materials and impeccable sound quality, puts K-array products on the forefront of cutting edge professional sound reinforcement.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/10458", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685678"}, "embedding": null}

DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY 60 KH8 rev. A 5 INTRODUCTION The KH8 is one of the world’s first flexible digital “slim array technology” line array speakers (S.A.T); slim and compact in design, self-powered and weather resistant providing an exceptional peak output of 145 dB SPL offering a rather different solution to the touring audio market. It is fully controlled by the on- board DSPs for hyper detailed beam steering and maximum operational flexibility. Its counterpart, the KS8, is a compact, self-powered, weather resistant subwoofer element providing an exceptional peak output of 148 dB SPL. This too has dynamic set up options for optimum delay calibration. A system of 24 KH8 units can be flown in just 10 minutes. This is possible because it is not necessary to dismount the entire cluster: the speakers are anchored in groups of three within rigid frames that can be connected quickly to create longer clusters (uJZ picp to 24 units). Compared to traditional systems that require wiring and a mechanical connection for each speaker, the KH8 saves time. Every unit can be independently tilted to focus the sound mechanically and then digitally steered. The portability and ease of assembly are just some of the advantages of configuring a “straight array”. For example, suppose you want to change the inclination angle of a speaker when the cluster has already been hoisted: with the KH8 it is not necessary to pull the cluster down, it is sufficient for someone to change the tilt of the single speaker, an operation that requires no more than a few minutes. In addition, the “straight array technology” minimises the cluster’s volume and allows maximum freedom on where they are hoisted. For instance, you don’t need much space in depth behind the cluster which instead can be flown almost attached to a wall or a Layer tower. The result is to obtain a wave front that has the desired curvature from a perfectly vertical cluster. “We like to say the bananas go digital”. KS8 features IPAL® driver and amplifier technology, including a powerful amplifier module, a differential pressure sensing device, a “zero latency” DSP and two 21′′ specifically designed high efficiency transducers, providing an exceptional peak output of 148 dB SPL. The IPAL® technology allows to correct the intrinsic uncertainties of the acoustical system in real time for state of the art performances. System linearity is guaranteed by a feedback correction based on a differential pressure control method. The integrated DSP ensures an astonishing 10 μs (microseconds) latency on the critical feedback paths allowing “analog type” feedback approach with the flexibility of a DSP core. The KS8 subwoofers are also integrated in the aiming and design software to give endless possibilities of configuration for example; carded or virtual arcs and whatever the venue will require. KH8 rev. A 6 DIGITAL STEERING The strength of a conventional line array system is its possibility to generate a wavefront that tends to assume a cylindrical shape, longer than a normal array with respect to the emitted wavelength. This allows for uniform coverage and a focused energy that can be directed by the sound engineer. Focusing energy on the vertical plane means that, in the case of an ideal array, the attenuation of the sound pressure will be 3 dB for each doubling distance of the diffuser, in front of the 6 dB of attenuation to occur in the case of sources with spherical emission. Theoretically the line array should be rectilinear to ensure an optimal relationship between sound sources. However, in many cases, to adequately cover the entire listening area the array needs to be curved in a “J” or “banana” shape. This allows you, through controlling the angle of each speaker in relation to the other, to reach also the audience which sits or stands in proximity of the PA’s feet. The “J” configuration is currently the most widespread and produces the highest performance but it also has many limitations in terms of practicality. KH8 rev. A 7 An intelligent system such as the KH8 requires a dedicated software to make preparation and setup easy and, equally, give the user plenty to play with. With AFMG®, we approached the most successful software developers in the pro-audio market. Together, we developed the first real FIRmaker implementation where users will have the power to create their own FIR filtersets optimized for each setup they use their KH8 system in.

All DSP functions are fully remote controlled via software over Ethernet. 4.1 PHYSICAL Weight 72.5 Kg (159.84 lb) KH8 rev. A 18 The aluminum box which contains the amplifier unit is mechanically fastened with 8 screws to the main chassis. A multi-pin cable with a LK19 plug connects the amp output to the transducers. This setup allows for a very easy amp replacement whenever it becomes necessary. CAUTION! Risk of electric shock. The amplifier module and any audio equipment connected to it (mixing consoles, processors, etc.) must be properly connected to the AC power distribution, preserving AC line polarity. Every grounding point must be connected to a single node or common point using the same cable gauge as the neutral and line cable. Bad grounding connections between speakers and the rest of the equipment may produce noise, hum or serious damage to the input/output stages in the system’s electronic equipment. 4.3 AC POWER Before applying AC to any K-array self-powered speaker, be sure that the voltage potential difference between neutral and earth ground is less than 5 VAC. 4.2 AMPLIFIER ENCLOSURE Before going on to replace the amplifier box, make sure to have unplugged the AC power cable. KH8 rev. A 19 5.4 CURRENT REQUIREMENT 5.5 PROTECTION CIRCUITRY The auto-range power supply feature allows the amp unit to operate safely and with no audio discontinuity when the AC voltage stays within a nominal range of 100 - 240 V (operating range 85 - 265 V) at 50 or 60 Hz. Please verify that your AC main connections are capable of satisfying the power rating for the device. CAUTION. Do not connect the system to AC power mains exceeding 265 V. Doing so will cause significant damage to the device and create serious risk for users! The amplifier presents a dynamic load to the AC mains, drawing additional current as operating levels increase. Different cables and circuit breakers heat up at varying rates, so it is essential to understand current ratings and how they correspond to circuit breaker and cable specifications. Maximum continuous RMS current - measured over a period of at least ten seconds - is used to calculate the temperature increase in cables, which drives the proper size and gauge cable and rating for slow-reacting thermal breakers. Maximum burst RMS current - measured over a period of approximately one second - is used to select the rating for fast reacting magnetic breakers. The amplifier modules are equipped with several protection circuits to prevent damage. Many audio limiters protect the internal circuitry against overload. A Peak Current Shut Down protects the output stage with a tripping point at 54 Apeak. If tripped, Peak Current Shut Down will reset after 2 seconds. A Temperature Protection Limiter ensures the output stage stays below a temperature of 70°C (approximate temperature of output power device). High frequency stationary signals, like steady sinusoidal signals – improperly referred as continuous or permanent signals – with high amplitude tend to stress the amplifier section of the modules as well as the loudspeakers voice coils. When a high frequency stationary loud signal is feed into the amplifier a dedicated Limiter limits its mean current depending on its level and frequency. The process is auto adaptive and frequency driven: at higher frequency the Limiter acts faster. For best performance, voltage drops should not exceed 10% at 100 V or 10% at 230 V. The minimum electrical service amperage required by a K-array loudspeakers system is the sum of their maximum continuous RMS current. K-array recommends allowing an additional 30% above the minimum amperage to prevent peak voltage drops at the service entry. 5.3 VOLTAGE REQUIREMENT KH8 rev. A 20 1. Power input.

The amplifier module is equipped with several protection circuits to prevent damage. A Current Limiter, a Current Clamp and an Over Current Protection protect the output stage and the connected loudspeakers from dangerously high peak currents. A Power Limiter ensures that the module’s real average output power does not exceed the maximum value allowed. It features also a Brownout Limiter, a fast acting output peak power limiter that quickly reduces the amplifier gain when the rails voltage decrease quickly due to an excessive current/power draw from the load. An Excursion Limiter keeps the loudspeaker cone range of movement within a defined range. The Excursion Limiter works through a current loop, dynamically changing the value of a resistance value proportionally to the estimated displacement of the cone with respect to its resting position. A Thermal Limiter reduces the output stage temperature when it exceeds the maximum value allowed. For best performance, voltage drops should not exceed 10% at 100 V or 10% at 230 V.

You can power up to 12 KH8/KS8 with a single Power Distro and you can distribute the speakers among the two OUPUT. This can be very usefull, for exemple, if you want to power a KH8 cluster and a KS8 cluster with a single Power Distro. In that case you can connect the KH8 cluster to OUTPUT A and the KS8 cluster to output B, making the cabling more pratical. 10. \u0007WIRING KEY: this scheme shows the three-phase distribution among the Speaker Switches and the Service Outputs. As shown, each phase is shared between four switches (therefore between four speakers) and one Service Output. The following picture shows some typical configurations explaining the relation between the switches on the Power Distro and the speakers connected to it. The concept is simple: if you connect a cluster to Output A, the first unit is controlled by the first switch in the upper left corner (A1+B12), the second one is controlled by the next switch (A2+B11) and so on till the 12th speaker of the cluster which is controlled by the last switch in the bottom right corner (A12+B1). If you connect a cluster to Output B, the switches order is reversed: the first unit is controlled by the last switch in the bottom right corner (A12+B1), the second one is controlled by the previous switch (A11+B2) and so on till the 12th speaker of the cluster that is controlled by the first switch in the upper left corner (A1+B12). This system may appear confusing but actually it is extremely practical: if you have two separated clusters connected to a single Power Distro (e.g. a KH8 cluster and a KS8 cluster), you do not need to link them with a power cable. Just connect a cluster to OUT A and the other to OUT B and you still have a single switch controlling a single unit. KH8 rev.

A 33 7.8 SENDING POWER TO SPEAKERS KH8 and KS8 features a PowerCon connector as Power Input. To connect a unit to the Power Distro in the K8-BOX (featuring two Socapex connectors) and to link together more units in a cluster, you need a KH8-PWBOX3 every three KH8s and a KS8-PWBOX3 every three KS8s. The two boxes have the same functionality, the only difference is the cables length. Another important difference is that KH8-PWBOX3 is pre-mounted and pre-cabled in the KH8-FRAME while KS8-PWBOX3 has to be connected by the user. This box features 5 cables: SOCAPEX MALE CONNECTOR Power from K8-BOX SOCAPEX FEMALE CONNECTOR Power to next box POWERCON CONNECTOR Power to first unit POWERCON CONNECTOR Power to second unit POWERCON CONNECTOR Power to third unit OUT 1 Phase 1 The box sends a different phase to each unit. In this way the load between units is well distributed among the three phases. All units are connected to common neutral and earth ground points. Another function of the box is to spin the Socapex wiring in such a way that the PowerCon cables coming out from the next box receive the signal from different pins. That’s how you can switch on and off each unit independently. ATTENTION When you connect the KS8-PWBOX3 to three KS8s, pay attention and respect the order: each PowerCon cable features a label (OUT 1, OUT 2, OUT 3), be sure to connect the OUT 1 to the first unit, the OUT 2 to the second and the OUT 3 to the third. This is important for the correct association between the power switches on the K8-BOX and the units. OUT 2 Phase 2 OUT 3 Phase 3 KS8-PWBOX3 KH8 rev. A 34 8.

If you absolutely need high uniformity or high power, choose the corresponding parameter. If you absolutely want to avoid sound in the areas selected above, choose Strong Avoidance. If you prefer a custom balancing between Power, Uniformity, Efficiency and Avoidance, choose Custom and set the amount of level for each parameter. Level Distribution Over Audience: we suggest to choose a 3.0 dB Reduction per Doubling Distance because it is the typical drop for a line array. Experiment also with the other values. Advanced: lets you choose the Frequency Range affected by FIR filters and the Spatial Resolution. We suggest not to set extreme values (very Low or very High). The user can also choose the kind of Automatic Equalization to be calculated in the optimization process in order to obtain a Flat Frequency Response, a Flat Frequency Response with Roll-Off or the Maximum Filter Gain. In most cases Maximum Filter Gain gives the best results. KH8 rev. A 40 6. \u0007Press Start and the software will compute the FIR Filters. Click Show Mapping to enable the SPL mapping display. It can take several minutes to show the results, but the FIR are already calculated and ready to be transferred to the speakers.

The suspension of large, heavy objects in public places is subject to numerous laws and regulations at the national/federal, state/provincial, and local levels. This manual does not address the specifics of any such applicable laws and government regulations. This manual details procedures and practices consistent with those generally acknowledged as allowable and safe in Europe. However, the user must assume responsibility for making sure that use of any K-array system and its components in any particular circumstance or venue conforms to all applicable laws and regulations in force at the time. SAFETY FACTOR. K8-FLY24 and KH8-FRAME3 are in conformity with UNI EN 13155:2009. The safety factor is equal to 10:1 on the breaking load. However there are wide variations internationally in the regulations and practices applying to suspension of sound systems in public places. Government officials in one location may have a stricter interpretation than another local official, even when operating under the same regulations and in the same legal jurisdiction. Consequently, users of K-array rigging systems should be prepared to take additional safety assurance measures beyond those outlined in this manual. in all cases, it is the responsibility of the user to make certain that any K-array loudspeaker system is suspended in accordance with all applicable national/federal, state/provincial, and local regulations. ATTACHMENT POINT. In most touring applications of rigging systems, the touring sound provider is normally responsible for ensuring the safety of the suspension system only below the attachment point. The safety and suitability of the attachment point is generally seen as the responsibility of the venue owner or operator. However ouring system operators should double-check to make certain that attachment points are approved and suitably load rated, and that the points used are those identified as such by the venue owner or operator. PERSONNEL HEALTH AND SAFETY. During installation and set-up personnel should wear protective headgear and footwear at all times. Under no circumstances personnel should climb on the loudspeaker assembly. WIND LOADS. In case of outdoor installation, assure that the wind does not interfere with the system’s stability, taking extra securities like chains, weights, ropes or any other certified anchoring systems. GROUND STACKING. Do not ground stack a KS8 cluster on uneven ground or platform. If the system is ground stacked on a structure, platform, or stage always check that it can support the total weight of the system. 9.1 GENERAL SAFETY In the following pages we show briefly how to suspend a KH8/KS8 cluster. Although this manual contains much useful information on rigging in general, it does not claim to be a comprehensive resource on the subject. This manual assumes that the owners and/or users of a K-array System are knowledgeable and experienced in the areas of rigging and flying loudspeaker systems. Many issues of crucial concern, such as the determination of appropriateness and condition of venue rigging points, cannot be addressed here. Therefore, the user must assume all responsibility for the appropriate use of K-array systems, in any particular location or circumstance. It is recommended to attend the training courses offered by K-array before proceeding with the installation of the system. KH8 rev. A 49 9.2 SUSPENDING A KH8 CLUSTER In the following step by step instructions we show how to suspend a 6 units cluster. To suspend a longer cluster just repeat the same steps over. Remember that you cannot connect in a daisy chain audio/data of more then 6 units together, so every six units you need to connect another audio/data cable coming from a KH8-BOX. The same happens with power: you can not link more then 12 units together. See chapter “7. power and signal/data distribution” (page 25) for more details about signal/data and power connections. WARNING Do not suspend more than 24 KH8 with one K8-FLY24 bumper! WLL for K8-FLY24 is 2400 Kg (5291 lb). 1. Move the dolly near the motor point. NOTE The cabinets, when carried on dolly, may be left with a maximum inclination of 10°. K-FLY24 WORKING LOAD LIMIT = 2400 Kg (5291 lb) The structure’s safety factor is equal to 10 on the breaking load KH8 rev. A 50 2. Hook the motor chains to the K-FLY24 bumber.

{"content": "KH8 system FAQ The main components of the system are: • KH8. Compact, self-powered, water resistant loudspeaker providing an exceptional peak output of 145 dB SPL. Fully controlled by the on-board DSPs for hyper detailed beam steering and maximum operational flexibility. • KS8. Compact, self-powered, water resistant subwoofer element providing an exceptional peak output of 148 dB SPL. The IPAL® technology allows to correct the intrinsic uncertainties of the acoustical system in real time for state of the art performances. System linearity is guaranteed by a feedback correction based on a differential pressure control method. • PRE-CABLE STACKS. The KH8 speakers are provided in pre-cable stacks of 3 units and you can fly a 24-unit cluster in less than 15 minutes! • K8-BOX. Power, signals and control box up to 12 KH8/KS8. You need just 2 multi-cables to drive a 6 units cluster: one multi-cable for sending analog, digital and data signals and another one to power the speakers. The state of the art power distro allows you to switch on and off each unit independently. • KH8-DOLLY. Each dolly can transport 2 pre-cabled stack of 3 KH8 units (6 KH8 in total). KS8-DOLLY. Each dolly can transport 1 pre-cabled stack of 3 KS8 units. Protective covers are available for both KH8-DOLLY and KS8-DOLLY. What are the system’s components? Why a straight array and not a “banana” configuration? The clusters of KH8 speakers are flown vertically, but each unit has the ability to be tilted totally independent. The result is to obtain a wave front that has the desired curvature from a perfectly vertical cluster. Easy transportation, quick setup, minimum cluster’s volume and maximum freedom on where they are hoisted are just a few of the advantages of a straight array configuration. The speakers are anchored in groups of three within rigid frames that can be connected quickly to create longer clusters. The three speakers inside each frame remain cabled, and are ready by simply connecting only two cables from each frame to the next. KH8 saves time, space and costs. NO OPTIMIZATION FIRmaker OPTIMIZATION What does “auto configuration” mean? It means that you can design your configurations off- site and just sync the system when it is up and on. A dedicated software allows you to design according to any venue requirement. By simply pressing a button, the software can suggest the most accurate speaker angle for optimal coverage in the targeted listening area. Press another button and the software will compute the best FIR settings to meet any demanding setup requirement and control sound spillover (i.e. excluding beam sound in specific areas). What does “Digital acoustic steering” mean? Acoustic steering is a technique that allows you to steer a speaker’s sound beam through the interaction of several speakers. The full potential of this technique can truly be maximized only when there is a system that allows you to precisely and independently control each element of the array, and if you have a powerful calculation software that can optimize all the parameters in order to obtain the desired acoustic result. The KH8 system meets these requirements. Each KH8 unit has 8 on-board DSP channels in order to drive all its section independently. Each of the 8 channels is designed to load FIR to achieve the best and the most accurate steering results. How about KH8 coverage? KH8 cluster’s coverage can be controlled mechanically - by adjusting the splay angles between units - and digitally by exploiting one of the key advantage of the KH8 system: the digital steering function. With KH8 you can focus beam sound in targeted areas, exclude beam sound in specific areas (i.e. the stage), check the directivity frequency and obtain an extremely uniform sound field. Yes! With the KH8 it is not necessary to pull the cluster down, it is sufficient for someone to go up and change the tilt of the speaker, an operation that requires no more than a few minutes. Can I change the inclination angle of a speaker when the cluster has already been hoisted? How many people are needed to hoist a 12-unit KH8 cluster? The state of the art rigging system allows a SINGLE person to fly 12 units in less than 10 minutes! This is possible because it is not necessary to mount and dismount the entire cluster every time: the speakers are anchored in groups of three within rigid pre-cabled frames. Each frame is placed on a standard dolly for practical transportation. How many cables do I need? Just two. You need a multi-cable with LK25 connectors to send analog, digital end data signals and a multi- cable with Socapex connectors to send power. Power and signal multi-cables are separated to avoid noise interference and risk of serious damages in case of accidental cable cutting. FAQ FAQ What makes KS8 different? KS8 features IPAL® driver and amplifier technology, including a powerful amplifier module, a differential pressure sensing device, a “zero latency” DSP and two 21″ specifically designed high efficiency transducers, providing an exceptional peak output of 148 dB SPL. The IPAL® technology allows to correct the intrinsic uncertainties of the acoustical system in real time for state of the art performances. System linearity is guaranteed by a feedback correction based on a differential pressure control method. The integrated DSP ensures an astonishing 10 µs (microseconds) latency on the critical feedback paths allowing “analog type” feedback approach with the flexibility of a DSP core. How many KH8 fit on a dolly? Each dolly can transport 2 pre-cabled stack of 3 KH8 units (6 KH8 in total). Protective covers are available. Can I fly the KS8 subwoofers? Absolutely. You can fly or stack the KS8. You can also connect a KS8 to a 3 KH8 unit stack so you can fly a cluster with the KS8 on the top and the KH8 on the bottom. Does the system have any outdoor application limitations? Absolutely not. KH8 and KS8 are IP45 systems with an integrated IP65 electronic enclosure, to resist even heavy rain.

{"content": "As one of the fastest rising stars of the international touring DJ circuit, trance DJ and producer Ben Nicky captured headlines when he announced his first large-scale solo headline show at Northern Ireland’s biggest venue, the Belfast SSE Arena. For the technical crew, meanwhile, the pressure was on to deliver a sound reinforcement system capable of meeting everyone’s high expectations. For Belfast-based rental company PSI and leading technical supplier Sonalyst UK, the clear choice was K-array Firenze. Firstly, load-in and load-out both had to take place on the day of the sold-out show; secondly, the front of house solution needed to cover 5,000 audience members with extremely hard-hitting, highly dynamic content. The first challenge was immediately dealt with courtesy of the extraordinary speed of rigging and set-up that K-array Firenze offers – from unpacking the system from the single truck in which it shipped, to having it flown and ready to perform, was a matter of just two hours. The need for a suitably impressive sonic performance, meanwhile, was taken care of in style with a remarkably compact but powerful design comprising of a total of 24 Firenze-KH8 flat panel speakers there were flown 12 per-side, supported by a mono distributed subwoofer setup of just 12 Firenze-KS8 subs. Control and equalization were handled via Firenze’s onboard DSP-based Armonia software, while EASE Focus was used for design and optimisation with accurate control of FIR steering. The show ran from 7pm until midnight with average sound pressure levels of over 108 db, plus a fairly punishing mix of music, and once again Firenze performed flawlessly. It provided a dynamic and precise balance from the source material, generating a full spectrum of frequencies from 30 Hz all the way up to 20 kHz with ease. Afterwards, load-out commenced at midnight and the entire rig was being loaded by 12.45am. From the reaction of the crowd and the crew alike, this was yet another extremely successful outing for K-array Firenze.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/ben-nicky-belfast", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685913"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "For 75 years, the Hahnenkamm Downhill in the exclusive Austrian ski resort of Kitzbühel has been the highlight of international alpine skiing as there is no faster race, none more spectacular, none more notoriously difficult. In 2015, the organizers assembled a large production team for the event to tackle the sub zero temperatures, abundance of snow and difficult terrain for transportation and building, and who called upon Musik Lenz to provide the audio for this complicated, but extremely prestigious event. The sound was required to travel in the same direction following a single time-path so the bulk of the clusters were installed to masts on either side of the finish line, with a number of delay systems further up the track. The finish area directly in front of the main grandstand was reserved for the Austrian broadcaster ORF and its international counterparts, therefore the sound reinforcement needed to resolve how to provide powerful coverage to the spectators in the grandstands without disturbing the broadcast teams trying to interview the competitors nearby. Similarly, the organizers had stipulated that the coverage designed to serve the spectators trackside should on no account spill onto the pistes themselves. The central masterpiece of the sound reinforcement was the Firenze-KH8 line array touring speaker and the powerful Firenze-KS8 subwoofer and the six-man sound team flew a line of 6 KH8 line arrays and 3 KS8 subs with 4 KH15 loudspeakers for side fill. One of the issues the team faced with the system was the extreme weather conditions. The Firenze series fought through 6 days of intense weather including high winds, big freezes and giant snow falls yet delivered clear, powerful sound over 200 m, throwing further SPL than the event has ever heard before. We were really satisfied with the system, everyone could clearly hear all the way up the mountain. The system was ultra-reliable even during the blizzards we encountered at the event. With the electronic steering of the KH8, we could keep the audio system out of sight making more room for the fans. We loved the KH15s used for side fill, it supported the Firenze system to give it more than we have ever heard before at this event.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/kitzbuhel-downhill", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685920"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Above the historic Shanghai Concert Hall on the 4th floor of the same building is the star quality Italian restaurant and mega nightclub Luce della Vita with an opulent interior design that takes inspiration from post-modern Rome. To match their ambitions to create a high-class hotspot in Shanghai that wows guests with great food and spectacular DJ lineup, owners required the help of a powerful audio solution that would beat through the core of the clubgoers yet, on the other hand, blend into the aesthetics and create relaxed experience for diners in the restaurant. It was a complicated task to avoid crossover with two extremely different audio requirements, but the sound team was confident in the options K-array provided. For the restaurant, a combination of Python-KP52 and Python-KP102 loudspeakers were positioned discreetly in the corners and on the walls of the room with the low end provided by Thunder-KMT18P subs flushed within the walls and powered with Kommander-KA24 and Kommander-KA84 amplifiers. The system was set high in frequencies to avoid conflicting with the powerful audio coming form the club. For the club 8 Firenze-KH8 loudspeakers were installed around the room with 8 KS8 subwoofers positioned below in the walls. This configuration and contrast of speakers did not have any impact between either room which was made possible with the electronic beam steering capabilities that directed the sound. The client was concerned that there would not be enough low frequencies and requested more subwoofers until the team turned on the KS8 before opening and the owners were in complete shock, they could not believe the power of the subs. In fact, just a few weeks after opening the local district asked for the bass to be turned down and after a plea from the owners, we have recently returned to reduce the low frequencies to keep everyone happy.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/luce-della-vita", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685927"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "K-array recently brought its sonic quality to the No Borders Music Festival 2023 – a listening experience in contact with nature that ran throughout July in Italy’s Friuli Alps. Headliner discovers how the K-array sound system has become a signature feature of the festival, and hears from some of those involved in this year’s outing. Friuli Venezia Giulia’s No Borders Music Festival, which this year entered its 28th edition, is one of those events you don’t want to miss. The location on the border between Italy, Austria, and Slovenia – although rather tricky to get to – is arguably one of the most beautiful and inspiring of any European summer festivals, accompanied by incredible sunrises, fresh mountain air, and scenic views of the valley below. Good vibes were promised from the jump, with a lineup that included Ben Harper, LP, Skunk Anansie, and Mika amongst many others. K-array was the chosen audio system by the rental company and festival organisers. Having sponsored the event in previous years, K-array has now become a signature audio style of the event itself. The collaboration aligns with K-array's commitment to support events that promote culture and respect for the environment, people, and artists. In a concert, sound plays a fundamental role, yet the listening experience can often fall short of expectations. Issues like excessively loud sound, uneven distribution, or unnatural audio quality can affect the audience's experience and distort the artistic performance. K-array’s audio technologies ensured superior sound quality, providing all attendees with the same listening conditions without altering the original sound. In this case, the sound system became a true artistic extension of the performer – respecting and enhancing their performance. As a festival with comparatively simple technical characteristics, the audio requirements demanded a classic L-R system with an arrayed sub line and front fills. Speaking exclusively to Headliner, K-array concert series product specialist, Klaus Hausherr, says, “The type of concerts that take place at the No Borders Music Festival require a very precise coverage of the public area, without disturbing the quiet of the mountains that frame this amazing location. The relationship with K-array started five years ago and we supplied, during the first years, a Mugello system (KH5 + KS5), to then move on to the Firenze series in the last two years (KH7 + KS8), with great satisfaction from the production.” The most important and unique feature of the K-array system on this occasion was its beam steering, which ensured an uncompromising listening experience throughout the festival area: “The configuration of the system was very simple, therefore there were no major difficulties,” adds Hausherr. “The use of beam steering in the system has guaranteed a very significant SPL balance (difference between front stage and back area 2/3dB), and a consistent frequency response over the whole area.” For the area's sound setup, a K-array Firenze-KH7 system was used, chosen for its uniform diffusion and precise sound control through digital steering, a crucial feature in reducing acoustic pollution in pristine environments like these. Sleek and compact, these self-powered and weather-resistant speakers offer a unique solution for live events. The compactness and efficiency of K-array speakers also make them ideal even for a setting like the No Borders Music Festival, handling these logistical challenges without compromising sound quality. “Since I have been following this festival for many years now, I can only give positive feedback on the behaviour of the system and the professionalism of the production,” Hausherr continues. “Almost all the sound engineers approached the sound system with a little diffidence, but as soon as they heard how it behaves, they all recognised an extraordinary definition, guaranteed by a very fast and constant transient response throughout the area.” The feedback on the system and its performance from all engineers involved has been overwhelmingly positive. The K-array system was provided by Arcadia, which has gained considerable experience over the years in technical services for entertainment, specialising in creating significant structural and scenic installations, lighting, audio, and video systems for theatre, television, and high-profile live music events. K-array has also established a close working relationship with Claudio Tognoni and the No Borders Music Festival production team, whose trust built over the years has led to continuous success in previous editions of the festival. Musician and songwriter Doro Gjat, who hails from the Friuli region and played No Borders again this year, tell Headliner how he first played the festival in 2017: “It was in a wonderful valley named Val Bartolo in amongst the mountains of Tarvisio, surrounded by little huts,” he says. “I loved the location and the energy of the crowd as well. What makes this festival so unique in its experience is the surroundings. Imagine being on a stage placed in front of a pine forest, right on the side of a little lake. The energy coming from the crowd is so synced with the environment – it's amazing!\" “Those in the crowd are the best qualified to answer the question of how the audio sounded; for me, based on working with everyone involved, I’ve never had any reason to complain. The audio service personnel have always been very professional, and absolutely on point with the equipment.\" “For me on stage, the K-array system sounded beautiful without being too loud, which is probably why the artistic direction of the festival leans more towards acoustic sets. The environment calls for moody sounds which pair well with the surroundings. Imagine being in a natural environment listening to industrial sounds – they won't fit. Otherwise, mellow guitars, beautiful voices enunciating beautiful words, long reverbs, natural delays and the right amount of percussion resonating through the woods is like the perfect solution.” Read the full article of Headliner Mag here", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/karray-headliner-live", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.685933"}, "embedding": null}

Firenze-systems User Guide 24 Electronic beam steering Traditional line array elements are appreciated for their narrow on-axis directivity: the Firenze-KH7P I breaks this paradigm with no need of any specific mechanical arrangement. The Firenze-KH7P I boasts four coaxial 12” neodymium magnet drivers with 3” voice coils. Each driver can be independently controlled and digitally tilted along the vertical axis to align with specific listening area requirements, thanks to EBS technology. This technology implements FIR filters for precise management across different frequency bands, allowing for accurate beam emission control. Thanks to EBS, the entire cluster can be mounted straight without the need for additional physical hardware for tilting, thus facilitating installation, hanging clusters with multiple elements, and ensuring more precise sound control. To make this element even lighter and further implement Slim Array Technology, Firenze-KH7P is now passive and no longer equipped with on-board amplification. However, this doesn’t pose an issue as it’s possible to use the dedicated amplifier, Kommander-KA104LIVE or Kommander-KA208LIVE, for managing each individual driver (4x channels of amplification for each driver). Alternatively, in the case of a comprehensive subwoofer element system, the Kommander-KA208LIVE can be utilized.

The K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units in demanding applications. • TUNING – Manage and control the loudspeaker system in real time: optimize the performance of the loudspeaker system during the tuning session and control its behavior in live events. The K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on-line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. The K-framework3 allows you to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available. Alternatively you can import from scratch in the workspace the real passive loudspeakers connected to the amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology in the same subnet. The K-framework3 operates in three modes: • 3D – Design a loudspeaker system for your venue in a fully 3D environment and make free field acoustic simulations; In this mode, it is also possible to load FIR filters for the EBS function and view the actual simulation of the sound beam orientation based on the target listening area (target frequency response.) • SETUP – import from the 3D design the active components into the workspace or build from scratch a PA system composed of active loudspeakers and amplifiers; use the input and output groups to allow full control of the system; OUTPUTS OUTPUTS DO NOT EXPOSE TO RAIN OR MOISTURE CAUTION: To reduce the risk of electric shock, the grounding of the center pin of the AC input must be maintained.

Before applying AC to any K-array self-powered speaker, ensure the voltage potential difference between neutral and earth ground is less than 5 VAC. 8. AMPLIFIER 8.2 VOLTAGE REQUIREMENTS The KMT12, KMT18 and KMT21’s switching power supply accommodates AC mains operating at either 115 V or 230 V. The amplifier will continue to operate safely, without interruption, provided that the AC voltage remains within this nominal range (operating range 90 - 135 V or 190 - 250 V) at 50 to 60 Hz. The KMT12 Mark I, KMT18 Mark I, KMT21 Mark I and KMT218’s auto-range power supply feature allows the amplifier unit to operate safely and without audio discontinuity when the AC voltage stays within a nominal range of 100 - 240 V (operating range 85 - 265 V) at 50 to 60 Hz. Please verify that your AC main connections are capable of satisfying the power rating for the device. CAUTION: Do not connect the system to AC mains power exceeding 265 V. Doing so will cause significant damage to the device and create serious risk for users! 8.3 CURRENT REQUIREMENTS The amplifier presents a dynamic load to the AC mains, drawing additional current as operating levels increase. Different cables and circuit breakers heat up at varying rates, so it is essential to understand current ratings and how they correspond to circuit breaker and cable specifications. Maximum continuous RMS current - measured over a period of at least ten seconds - is used to calculate the temperature increase in cables, which drives the proper size and gauge cable and rating for slow-reacting thermal breakers. Maximum burst RMS current - measured over a period of approximately one second - is used to select the rating for fast-reacting magnetic breakers. For best performance, voltage drops should not exceed 10% at 100 V or 10% at 230 V. The minimum electrical service amperage required by a K-array loudspeakers system is the sum of their maximum continuous RMS current. K-array recommends allowing an additional 30% above the minimum amperage to prevent peak voltage drops at the service entry. KR PORTABLE SYSTEM Ver. 1.0 25 8.4 PROTECTION CIRCUITRY Both the power supply and the amplifier sections are equipped with several protection circuits. The power supply protections aim to isolate a faulty section in the electrical power system from the rest of the device in order to prevent the furtherance of the fault and limit device damage. They comprise of overcurrent, overvoltage and thermal protections. Amplifier protections are triggered by audio signal current and voltage – by comparing input and output – and NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors. A Peak Current Shut Down and a Temperature Protection Limiter protect the output stage. High frequency stationary signals, like steady sinusoidal signals – improperly referred to as continuous or permanent signals – with high amplitude tend to stress the amplifier section of the modules as well as the loudspeaker’s voice coils. When a high frequency stationary loud signal is fed into the amplifier, a dedicated Limiter confines its mean current depending on its level and frequency.

{"content": "Astrakhan in south Russia, hosted an impressive classical music event which gathered an audience of more than 5,000 people. Set Inside the old walls of the Astrakhan Kremlin, a stronghold fortress that began construction in the 16th century, the Astrakhan State Theatre of Opera and Ballet performed an open-air presentation of the famous opera, Prince Igor by Alexander Borodin. On the night of the performance, the central square of the Kremlin was transformed into the seating area while the beautiful Cathedral of the Assumption and adjacent buildings served as the stage backdrop. A temporary 40 x 20 m platform was assembled for the orchestra at center stage. All sound equipment used for the performance, including Allen & Heath dLive mixing consoles, a main K-array PA system, and Audio-Technica microphones and wireless systems, was provided by Russia distributor MixArt. The main PA system consisted of two line arrays of 6 Dragon-KX12 coaxial point sources paired with 4 Thunder-KMT218 18” subwoofers. Two Pinnacle-KR802 portable systems were used as delay speakers and two Pinnacle-KR102 systems were used as front fills to ensure even coverage of the entire seating area. The sound quality surpassed all our expectations. K-array provided crystal clear and natural sound while being compact and almost invisible! One of our major concerns was to make sure that the audience would hear the true vocals, choir and orchestra instruments as if they were in the theater without sound reinforcement and the K-array systems did more than help us meet that aim!", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/kremlin-opera", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.686105"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "A Firenze system was used throughout a 10-date UK arena tour of street dance troupe Diversity, staged by Production North with Audiotech Services supplying the audio and video rigs. Tour stops included London's O2 Arena, Glasgow’s SSE Hydro, Nottingham’s Motorpoint Arena, the Manchester Arena, and Birmingham’s Barclaycard Arena. At the O2, the audio system demonstrated its time and cost savings benefits by requiring only 10 minutes of unloading and 10 minutes to fly the line arrays in a straight hang rather than curved. The system comprised of nine Firenze-KH8 panels per side plus side-hangs of two Firenze-KH7 elements per side, each containing four 12-inch coaxial drivers with rotating waveguides. On stage, two Pinnacle-KR802 portable systems were deployed as side fills while eight Mugello-KH2 loudspeakers lined the edge of the stage as front fills. 12 Firenze-KS8 subs provided low frequency support on the ground. The upper balcony of the arena was blocked but had the full arena been in use, only three additional KH8 loudspeakers per side would have been required. The last time I mixed front of house in the O2, I was running 18 boxes per side. This arena-sized touring system is occupying less than half of a truck. It sounds as good as any other system I’ve used. In fact because of the shallow box design the response is instant and there’s plenty of top end. It’s all there. When everyone moved from using point source clusters to line arrays, it was a big difference, but people got used to that change.

{"content": "We know how to engage and connect an audience with a show’s climatic and emotional performance. With our heritage in live sound, we’ve worked our entire life to create compact line-arrays to overcome any concert halls or performing arts venues challenges and constraints. Zealous fans, demanding performers, inadequate venues, setup and takedown time constraints are all important factors that must be taken into consideration. Our speakers allow sound to exit instantaneously without resonance resulting in a better impulse response, maximum clarity and definition for the audience. Whilst producing a sound dispersion with minimal back emission, keeping the stage clear of sound pollution and simultaneously keeping the performers happy. Our lightweight and compact concert solutions save space along with transportation costs keeping crews and organisers happy. We’ve rounded up three examples of how we’ve helped overcome these challenges. Gladiator's Live Concert, The Colosseum, Rome The Challenge When the Colosseum hosted a live screening of the film, The Gladiator, it was the embodiment of the perfect pairing! For one night only, Ridley Scott’s historical epic was screened in HD and accompanied by a live performance of the Hans Zimmer-composed soundtrack, courtesy of conductor Justin Freer and the musicians and choir of the Italian Film Orchestra. Australian vocalist, Lisa Gerrard, who sang on the movie’s soundtrack and served as its co-composer, also added her otherworldly talents to the event; all of which unfolded within the storied ruins of antiquity’s most infamous entertainment venue, the Colosseum. This prestigious event was staged by film score performance specialist CineConcerts, in support of Rotary’s End Polio Now campaign, and attended by stars of the film such as Maximus himself, Russell Crowe, and ‘the eighth king of Rome’; former AS Roma striker Francesco Totti. Such a luminous occasion required a truly world class audio setup; with the gauntlet ultimately being thrown down before technical supplier Planet Service - and the K-array Firenze system. The Solution These shows required a scaled-up production across the board, which meant bringing in kit and crew from K-array itself. The PA system at the Colosseum comprised of 3 Firenze-KH7 line array elements per side as main hangs, 4 Mugello-KS5 subwoofers, 16 Kobra-KK102 loudspeakers as front fill, and 3 sets of Python-KP102 loudspeakers lined down the entrance as left and right delays. There was a pair of KH7s flown in the middle of the truss, used specifically to project the film’s dialogue. As well as having very little space, the crew also had to deal with the relatively slender load limits that were afforded by the venue’s floor. This surface, which was originally installed to allow visitors to stand atop the labyrinthine bowels of Colosseum, can only support a maximum of 200 kg/sqm. The more substantial audio setup required at Circo Massimo meant that K-array was asked to provide a supplementary kit, including 24 of its flagship Firenze-KH8 speakers. The full rig was used on the more conventional festival-style stage at Circus Maximus consisting of 12 units of KH8 line array elements per side, 16 Firenze-KS8 subwoofers for low end reinforcement, 6 KH7s split as central left and right hangs, 8 Mugello-KH2 loudspeakers as front fill, and 3 more KH7s per side as delays. The Happy Customer “The major challenge was to have perfect PA coverage without being able to put the cluster in the correct position. The screen was on the back of the stage so we needed to stay as wide as possible with the main left and right hangs, in order to allow the best sight lines. The problem was that the speakers were so wide that they didn’t cover the central corridor adequately, so we added 3 rows of Pythons as delays to cover it with the same precision and quality as the rest of the venue. Wealso couldn’t fly a large PA because of these load limits, but the Firenze was very small and perfect for the job. This also helps with manoeuvrability during the load in and setup, which helps when you are essentially working inside a museum!” Alessandro Saudelli - Audio Crew Chief for rental company Planet Service Thessaloniki Concert Hall, Greece The Challenge Asproulis Experience and production company D:Tek needed a powerful sound with a long throw to cover the entire audience with uniform coverage, specifically for Mario Frangoulis’ Stranger in Paradise, accompanied by the Symphonic Orchestra of Thessaloniki with conductor Luke Karytinos. After demonstrating a K-array system for Fragoulis’ sound engineer Dimitris Bourboulis in the theatre, D:Tek and K-array were quickly given the green light. The Solution The system comprised 8 Kayman-KY102 loudspeakers in LCR order. The 4 Thunder-KMT218 subwoofers leading the L-R system were ground level while a Kommander-KA84 amplifier was used to drive the centre line array. A Pinnacle-KR402 portable system was employed for onstage side fills and the front fill was created with 4 half-metre Python-KP52 loudspeakers powered by a Kommander-KA24 amplifier. Setup and tuning had to be executed in a short time frame during rehearsals so D:Tek utilised the easy-to-use K-framework program to regulate and tune the entire system in under the one-hour window. David Geffen Hall, Lincoln Center of Performing Arts - USA The Challenge The New York Philharmonic presentation of four Star Wars films – A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and The Force Awakens – at Lincoln Center in Manhattan was presented in surround at 2,700-seat David Geffen Hall, and consisted of the film screenings accompanied by John Williams’ iconic score performed live by the 100-plus piece orchestra conducted by David Newman. One of the biggest tests for the audio team was to make the concert hall feel more like a movie house; ensuring the dialogue was clear, the effects physically palpable, and that the orchestra was able to successfully perform the soundtrack without “blowing people out of their seats.” Among the aspects of the sound design requiring a great deal of consideration and planning were an orchestra clocking in at about 92-plus dB, the necessity of placing surround elements (as well as subwoofers) in close proximity to audience members, and maintaining sonic imagery in locations presenting far greater challenges than the average movie theatre. After trying many different speaker configurations, K-array proved the key to coverage with its electronic beam steering and was ultimately selected to comprise the main PA along with the venue’s permanently installed subwoofers. The main system centre cluster consisted of six Mugello-KH2 active line array elements flown at the centre of the stage proscenium and flanked by a cardioid subwoofer on each side. Left, centre and right (LCR) main arrays, also flown at the proscenium, were also composed of Mugello-KH2s, each with seven elements. For rear surround a dozen Pinnacle-KR102 portable systems were employed with three Pinnacle-KR102 systems per seating level, placed left, centre and right, joined by companion subs and a satellite array for emphasis on higher frequency content. The compact sub elements of the Pinnacles were key in bolstering low-end reinforcement, particularly that of FX and source material.

Product Overview Weight 29.0 kg (63.9 lbs) Connecting hardware included KH2 Ver. 1.4 9 7.1 AC POWER The amplifier module and any audio equipment connected to it (mixing consoles, processors, etc.) must be properly connected to the AC power distribution, preserving the AC line polarity. Every grounding point must be connected to a single node or common point using the same cable gauge as the neutral and line cable. Bad grounding connections between speakers and the rest of the equipment may produce noise, hum or serious damage to the input/output in the system’s electronic equipment. Before applying AC to any K-array self-powered speaker, ensure that the voltage potential difference between neutral and earth ground is less than 5 VAC. 7. amplifier 7.2 VOLTAGE REQUIREMENTs The auto-range power supply feature allows the unit to operate safely and without audio discontinuity when the AC voltage stays within a nominal range of 100 - 240 V (operating range 85 - 265 V) at 50 to 60 Hz. Please verify that your AC mains power connections are capable of satisfying the power rating for the device. CAUTION. Do not connect the system to the AC mains power exceeding 265 V. Doing so will cause significant damage to the device and create serious risk for users! 7.3 CURRENT REQUIREMENTs The amplifier presents a dynamic load to the AC mains power, drawing additional current as operating levels increase. Different cables and circuit breakers heat up at varying rates, so it is essential to understand current ratings and how they correspond to the circuit breaker and cable specifications. Maximum continuous RMS current - measured over a period of at least ten seconds - is used to calculate the temperature increase in cables which drives the proper size, gauge cable and rating for slow-reacting thermal breakers. Maximum burst RMS current - measured over a period of approximately one second - is used to select the rating for fast-reacting magnetic breakers. For best performance, voltage drops should not exceed 10% at 100 V or 10% at 230 V. The minimum electrical service amperage required by a K-array loudspeaker system is the sum of its maximum continuous RMS current. K-array recommends allowing an additional 30% above the minimum amperage to prevent peak voltage drops at the service entry. 3.4 2 17.1 A 14.8 A 2.6 1.2 KH2 Ver. 1.4 10 1 2 4 6 3 5 9 10 7 8 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 7.4 PROTECTION CIRCUITRY Both the power supply and the amplifier sections are equipped with several protection circuits. Power supply protections aim to isolate a faulty section in electrical power system from the rest of the device in order to prevent the propagation of the fault and limit device damages. They comprise overcurrent, overvoltage and thermal protections. Amplifier protections are triggered by audio signal current, voltage – by comparing input and output – and NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors. A Peak Current Shut Down and a Temperature Protection Limiter protect the output stage. High frequency stationary signals, like steady sinusoidal signals – improperly referred to as continuous or permanent signals – with high amplitude tend to stress the amplifier section of the modules as well as the loudspeakers’ voice coils. When a high frequency stationary loud signal is fed into the amplifier, a dedicated Limiter confines its mean current depending on its level and frequency. 7.5 rear panel KH2 Ver. 1.4 11 1) CH1 Line Input.

INFO The Info page contains information about the current software and firmware, the current preset loaded and the Board ID of the device. The Board ID is a number which identifies the device when it is connected in a K-framework network (see Paragraph 7.6). Make sure that each device in the network has a different ID number. KH2 Ver. 1.4 15 9. digital steering - EASE Focus Acoustic steering is a technique that allows you to steer a speaker’s sound beam through the interaction of several loudspeakers. The full potential of this technique can truly be maximized only when there is a system that allows you to precisely and independently control each element of the array. A powerful software that can optimize all the parameters in order to obtain the desired acoustic result is required. The KH2 features this capability and each unit has an onboard DSP designed to load FIR filters to achieve the best and the most accurate steering results. FIR coefficients can be easily calculated with EASE Focus, the industry’s most accurate acoustic simulation software. Based on input data describing location geometry and sound sources, the software computes optimal filter transfer functions that can be automatically converted to FIR filters. EASE Focus software and its user guide can be downloaded from the AFMG website: focus.afmg.eu 10. remote control - k-framework All DSP functions, including system EQ, delay and loading of FIR filters calculated with EASE Focus, can be controlled using the K-framework software.

Every grounding point must be connected to a single node or common point using the same cable gauge as the neutral and line cable. Bad grounding connections between speakers and the rest of the equipment may produce noise, hum or serious damage to the input/output stages in the system’s electronic equipment. Before applying AC to any K-array self-powered speaker, ensure the voltage potential difference between neutral and earth ground is less than 5 VAC. 8. AMPLIFIER 8.2 VOLTAGE REQUIREMENTS The KMT12, KMT18 and KMT21’s switching power supply accommodates AC mains operating at either 115 V or 230 V. The amplifier will continue to operate safely, without interruption, provided that the AC voltage remains within this nominal range (operating range 90 - 135 V or 190 - 250 V) at 50 to 60 Hz. The KMT12 Mark I, KMT18 Mark I, KMT21 Mark I and KMT218’s auto-range power supply feature allows the amplifier unit to operate safely and without audio discontinuity when the AC voltage stays within a nominal range of 100 - 240 V (operating range 85 - 265 V) at 50 to 60 Hz. Please verify that your AC main connections are capable of satisfying the power rating for the device. CAUTION: Do not connect the system to AC mains power exceeding 265 V. Doing so will cause significant damage to the device and create serious risk for users! 8.3 CURRENT REQUIREMENTS The amplifier presents a dynamic load to the AC mains, drawing additional current as operating levels increase. Different cables and circuit breakers heat up at varying rates, so it is essential to understand current ratings and how they correspond to circuit breaker and cable specifications. Maximum continuous RMS current - measured over a period of at least ten seconds - is used to calculate the temperature increase in cables, which drives the proper size and gauge cable and rating for slow-reacting thermal breakers. Maximum burst RMS current - measured over a period of approximately one second - is used to select the rating for fast-reacting magnetic breakers. For best performance, voltage drops should not exceed 10% at 100 V or 10% at 230 V. The minimum electrical service amperage required by a K-array loudspeakers system is the sum of their maximum continuous RMS current. K-array recommends allowing an additional 30% above the minimum amperage to prevent peak voltage drops at the service entry. KR PORTABLE SYSTEM Ver. 1.0 25 8.4 PROTECTION CIRCUITRY Both the power supply and the amplifier sections are equipped with several protection circuits. The power supply protections aim to isolate a faulty section in the electrical power system from the rest of the device in order to prevent the furtherance of the fault and limit device damage. They comprise of overcurrent, overvoltage and thermal protections. Amplifier protections are triggered by audio signal current and voltage – by comparing input and output – and NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors. A Peak Current Shut Down and a Temperature Protection Limiter protect the output stage. High frequency stationary signals, like steady sinusoidal signals – improperly referred to as continuous or permanent signals – with high amplitude tend to stress the amplifier section of the modules as well as the loudspeaker’s voice coils. When a high frequency stationary loud signal is fed into the amplifier, a dedicated Limiter confines its mean current depending on its level and frequency.

{"content": "Polimoda is a prestigious private fashion school in Florence that is helmed by Ferruccio Ferragamo and is considered the top design school in Italy. To receive a degree, final year students are required to develop their own collection and present to the public at the annual fashion show that occurs during the world famous Pitti fashion week. Polimoda’s 2019 fashion show featured the memorable work of 22 talented young designers, who showcased their work to hundreds of guests and international industry insiders at the former tobacco-factory-turned-event-hall Manifattura Tabacchi. The runway was tucked inside the concrete open space of the industrial multipurpose venue and once the show began, the fluidity of the techno-primitive music that was well-coordinated with the Supernature theme, raised vibrations and made hearts beat faster. Through the use of video, computer animation and advanced audio systems which were provided by K-array, the audience experienced a supernatural immersive reality and sensory overload. To overcome the reverberation in the acoustically-challenging factory venue, 3 Pinnacle-KR402 portable systems were lined along the runway. The columns featuring Pure Array Technology provided a narrow dispersion on the vertical plane to provide a long throw and avoid ceiling reverberation. The modular capabilities of the systems were highlighted when one of the KR402 was switched with its 18\" Thunder-KMT18 subwoofers for 2 Thunder-KMT21 21\" subs to provide an even more powerful low end for the bass-filled playlist.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/polimoda-fashion-show", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.686263"}, "embedding": null}

Short Speakon cable Long Speakon cable KR PORTABLE SYSTEM Ver. 1.0 24 8.1 AC POWER The amplifier module and any audio equipment connected to it (mixing consoles, processors, etc.) must be properly connected to the AC power distribution, preserving the AC line polarity. Every grounding point must be connected to a single node or common point using the same cable gauge as the neutral and line cable. Bad grounding connections between speakers and the rest of the equipment may produce noise, hum or serious damage to the input/output stages in the system’s electronic equipment. Before applying AC to any K-array self-powered speaker, ensure the voltage potential difference between neutral and earth ground is less than 5 VAC. 8. AMPLIFIER 8.2 VOLTAGE REQUIREMENTS The KMT12, KMT18 and KMT21’s switching power supply accommodates AC mains operating at either 115 V or 230 V. The amplifier will continue to operate safely, without interruption, provided that the AC voltage remains within this nominal range (operating range 90 - 135 V or 190 - 250 V) at 50 to 60 Hz. The KMT12 Mark I, KMT18 Mark I, KMT21 Mark I and KMT218’s auto-range power supply feature allows the amplifier unit to operate safely and without audio discontinuity when the AC voltage stays within a nominal range of 100 - 240 V (operating range 85 - 265 V) at 50 to 60 Hz. Please verify that your AC main connections are capable of satisfying the power rating for the device. CAUTION: Do not connect the system to AC mains power exceeding 265 V. Doing so will cause significant damage to the device and create serious risk for users! 8.3 CURRENT REQUIREMENTS The amplifier presents a dynamic load to the AC mains, drawing additional current as operating levels increase. Different cables and circuit breakers heat up at varying rates, so it is essential to understand current ratings and how they correspond to circuit breaker and cable specifications. Maximum continuous RMS current - measured over a period of at least ten seconds - is used to calculate the temperature increase in cables, which drives the proper size and gauge cable and rating for slow-reacting thermal breakers. Maximum burst RMS current - measured over a period of approximately one second - is used to select the rating for fast-reacting magnetic breakers. For best performance, voltage drops should not exceed 10% at 100 V or 10% at 230 V. The minimum electrical service amperage required by a K-array loudspeakers system is the sum of their maximum continuous RMS current. K-array recommends allowing an additional 30% above the minimum amperage to prevent peak voltage drops at the service entry. KR PORTABLE SYSTEM Ver. 1.0 25 8.4 PROTECTION CIRCUITRY Both the power supply and the amplifier sections are equipped with several protection circuits. The power supply protections aim to isolate a faulty section in the electrical power system from the rest of the device in order to prevent the furtherance of the fault and limit device damage. They comprise of overcurrent, overvoltage and thermal protections. Amplifier protections are triggered by audio signal current and voltage – by comparing input and output – and NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors. A Peak Current Shut Down and a Temperature Protection Limiter protect the output stage. High frequency stationary signals, like steady sinusoidal signals – improperly referred to as continuous or permanent signals – with high amplitude tend to stress the amplifier section of the modules as well as the loudspeaker’s voice coils. When a high frequency stationary loud signal is fed into the amplifier, a dedicated Limiter confines its mean current depending on its level and frequency.

{"content": "The Forsthofalm Hotel is one-of-a-kind, 7-story building with a roof-top pool, constructed completely from wood for a sustainable architecture using local resources while supporting local companies for a minimum environmental impact. When it came time to integrate the audio system into the architectural design of the hotel, Mr. Markus Widauer, the hotel’s owner, and Mr. Linzmaier, the electrical engineer in charge of the planning, appointed Musik Lenz to design, supply and install an upgraded sound reinforcement system to meet all the demands of the hotel owner, providing wiring schemes for the electrician and fitting all the parts into a working system for the entrance, the two restaurants, the spa and wellness center, and the rooftop pool as well as the lounge on the outdoor terrace and in the bar. The system needed to be fully integrated with the existing system and be individually controlled in several multi-room configurations with one simple interface for easy use. Active Tornado-KT2 were installed for the background music areas while the lounge area features Kobra-KK52 line arrays and Thunder-KMT12 subwoofers as well as Lyzard-KZ14 mini loudspeakers and Rumble-KU26 subwoofers.

{"content": "Quito is the host city for the 53rd International Eucharistic Congress 2024, which aims to guide the Catholic Church's mission around the world. Quito welcomed delegations from all continents to participate in the Eucharistic Feast held at Parque Bicentenario. The solemn Eucharistic celebration featured a video message from Pope Francis, participation from the Archbishop and Primate of Ecuador, the Papal Legate, dozens of bishops from abroad, priests, deacons, seminarians, hundreds of religious men and women, 500 musicians, and more than 1,600 boys and girls who received their First Communion. Approximately 50,000 people attended the open area of Parque Bicentenario, experiencing the largest gathering of faith. “Hundreds of locals, Ecuadorians, and visitors from other countries filled the various spaces of the vast Eucharistic field, while religious music played through the loudspeakers. In his homily, the Papal Legate highlighted the organization of this great universal church gathering.” The sound system setup began four days before the mega-event, providing audio for conferences and concerts within the Metropolitan Convention Center and for the two Eucharistic celebrations in the open area of Parque Bicentenario. The system consisted of ten arrays distributed throughout the auditorium and the main PA system for the outdoor event, including front fill, out fill, side fill, and four delay systems. This event is unique because it is the first large-scale event in Ecuador to feature a single brand of sound equipment, and it represents the most important Catholic event in the world, held every four years in a new location.

The K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units in demanding applications. The K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on-line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. The K-framework3 allows you to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available. Alternatively you can import from scratch in the workspace the real active loudspeakers and amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology in the same subnet. The K-framework3 operates in three modes: • 3D – Design a loudspeaker system for your venue in a fully 3D environment and make free field acoustic simulations; • SETUP – import from the 3D design the active components into the workspace or build from scratch a PA system composed of active loudspeakers and amplifiers; use the input and output groups to allow full control of the system; • TUNING – Manage and control the loudspeaker system in real time: optimize the performance of the loudspeaker system during the tuning session and control its behavior in live events. The network shall comprise: • single PC or MAC, running the K-framework3 software with network interface 100Mbps (or higher); • router with DHCP server 100Mbps (or higher); • Ethernet switch (usually integrated into the router) 100Mbps (or higher); • Cat5 (or higher) Ethernet cables. A DHCP server is highly recommended even if the Mugello-KH active units implement the zeroconf network technologies: if a DHCP service is not available, each Mugello-KH active array element will self assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16 (auto-IP). K-framework3 WINDOWS and OSX software K-framework3 Router/Switch with DHCP server Sidebar Toolbar Workspace Menu bar PC/MAC running the K-framework3 software Mugello-KH I User Guide 15 Grouping The working paradigm in the K-framework3 is to group the input and output channels of the active units on the workspace and adjust the system performance within the groups. Groups can be created working both off-line and on-line and are retained by the real units even once unplugged: if a real device belongs to a group, the group is re-created on the workspace during the synchronization process. An active loudspeaker or amplifier might belong to multiple groups sharing its features (eq filters, time delay, volume, etc). Discovery 1. Ensure that the Mugello-KH units and the PC/Mac running the K-framework3 are properly connected to the same network and belong to the same subnet. 2. Power up the Mugello-KH units. 3. Launch the K-framework3. 4. Open the Network window and launch the discovery: • For back compatibility with legacy Mugello-KH units, by default the discovery over the RS485 serial communication is active: in case no legacy Mugello-KH units are present, disable the discovery over the RS485 serial communication. 5. Once discovered, the real units are shown in the left columns, following the order of their ID number; if the workspace contains virtual devices of the same type you can eventually modify the IDs in order to match the units and allows the synchronization. The synchronization can be in either directions: Workspace-to-Real or Real-to- Workspace. Select the sync direction and synchronize all or the single units separately • If the K-framework3 finds two or more devices with the wrong ID, a dialog window appears where unique IDs can be assigned to the units. A. In Setup mode, set the Mugello-KH units local parameters (presets, routing, input gains, limiters, etc). B. Add INPUT and OUTPUT groups as needed. C. Assign the Mugello-KH units’ channels to the groups. D. Switch to Tuning mode. E. Align the system using the tools available on the groups (eq, delay, polarity, etc). The K-framework3 synchronization process reset to default the EQ, delay and volume parameters edited with the K-array Control mobile app and the embedded Web app. Mugello-KH I User Guide 16 Rigging Procedures Suspended Array Needed Equipment Name Description Image Apply to K-HCFLY2 I Bumper for KH2 I-KS3 I - BLACK KH2 I / KH2P I KS3 I / KS3P I K-HCFLY2W I Bumper for KH2 I-KS3 I - WHITE KH2 I / KH2P I KS3 I / KS3P I K-HCFLY35 I Bumper for KH5 I-KH3 I-KS4 I - BLACK KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KS4 I / KS4P I K-HCFLY35W I Bumper for KH5 I-KH3 I-KS4 I - WHITE KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KS4 I / KS4P I K-HCFLYST2 Fly bar for KH2 I step array KH2 I / KH2P I K-HCFLYST Fly bar for KH5 I-KH3 I step array KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I K-STEPM2 I Step array hardware for KH2 I (kit for 1 unit) KH2 I / KH2P I K-STEPM3 I Step array hardware for KH3 I (kit for 1 unit) KH3 I / KH3P I K-STEPM5 I Step array hardware for KH5 I (kit for 1 unit) KH5 I / KH5P I K-HCLINK2/35 Adapter to join KH2 I to a KH3 I or a KH5 I (or cluster) KH5 I / KH5P I KH3 I / KH3P I KH2 I / KH2P I Key rigging components must be inspected before each use.

It is one of the largest and most important rooms in Italy in terms of artistic and historic value. Hosts foreign dignataries, press conferences, and government, corporate and private events. Proprietors saw the need for a fixed audio system with the ability to adapt to the different occasions. Required optimal coverage, low visual impact and confronting the hall's biggest challenge: high reverberancy. The large frescoed walls, the very high ceilings and lack of specific acoustic treatment abruptly reflect sound. To avoid reflections, which creates a sort of rumble sound and greatly damages the intelligibility inside the room, integrators Expomeeting proposed a portable line array speaker system composed of long Kobra line arrays and 2 Thunder subwoofers. Two 3-meter columns were installed on each side of the stage to not only minimize reverberation, but also effectively cover the entire salon, despite its 50m in length, And for proper monitoring for guest speakers or performers on the stage, two additional Kobra line array speakers were installed vertically behind the main system. All parties were quite pleased with the installation. The integrators felt the column arrays are the perfect setup for the room.

{"content": "Gran Carpa Cathedral is a nonprofit religious organization in the city of Cayey in central Puerto Rico. To promote its main objective of spreading the gospel to support a large parish of over 85,000 worshipers, in 2006 the organization began the process of creating the world’s largest outdoor covered congregation. The land where the “cathedral” was constructed has an area of 459,360 square meters – a space equivalent to 4 international soccer fields – and the “roof” is comprised of 42,000 square meters of tensioned canvas. Given the complicated structural setup and large audience seating, management needed a sophisticated audio system to meet all their demands. K-array was recommended by the sound engineer of the cathedral and, after multimedia director and vice secretary Julio Angel Cruz Fernandez heard a demo of the Firenze-KH7 system, the system was immediately selected as the church’s audio. 30 Firenze-KH7 loudspeakers are paired with 13 Thunder-KMT18 subwoofers and 2 Mugello-KS5 subwoofers to cover the entire cathedral as the main PA. 5 KF12MT loudspeakers are employed for stage monitors and 7 Dragon-KX12 are used as front fill. All systems were connected using the K-DANTE accessory. The installation and tuning were completed as a combined effort from the K-array distributors for Central America and Caribbean and for the United States as well as team members from K-array Global. However, before the inaugural assembly could take place, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Maria and the island suffered mass devastation. After making many repairs, the congregation will soon be operational. We are close to the inauguration of La Gran Carpa Cathedral but since the K-array system is already installed we have completed testing and we are extremely satisfied with the performance of the system. In such a difficult venue as ours, we can really appreciate the outstanding sound quality the speakers produce and the different frequencies they can reach. Also given that we have a Dante system, it is amazing that everything works well every time even after we turn it off since it makes discovery so transparent for the user. It’s so easy to deploy. The team from K-array was very supportive of our goals and vision for the installation and for that, we are very grateful.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/gran-carpa", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.686630"}, "embedding": null}

The K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units in demanding applications. The K-framework3 can work either off-line with virtual devices or on-line with real active loudspeakers and amplifiers connected over the same Ethernet network. The K-framework3 allows you to start designing the PA system off-line and sync the virtual devices to the real ones on site, when the devices are available. Alternatively you can import from scratch in the workspace the real active loudspeakers and amplifiers available on the network. In both cases, in order to discover and sync the active devices, both the PC or Mac running the K-framework3 and the real units shall be properly connected to the same Local Area Network – LAN – with star topology in the same subnet. The K-framework3 operates in three modes: • 3D – Design a loudspeaker system for your venue in a fully 3D environment and make free field acoustic simulations; • SETUP – import from the 3D design the active components into the workspace or build from scratch a PA system composed of active loudspeakers and amplifiers; use the input and output groups to allow full control of the system; • TUNING – Manage and control the loudspeaker system in real time: optimize the performance of the loudspeaker system during the tuning session and control its behavior in live events. The network shall comprise: • single PC or MAC, running the K-framework3 software with network interface 100Mbps (or higher); • router with DHCP server 100Mbps (or higher); • Ethernet switch (usually integrated into the router) 100Mbps (or higher); • Cat5 (or higher) Ethernet cables. A DHCP server is highly recommended even if the Mugello-KH active units implement the zeroconf network technologies: if a DHCP service is not available, each Mugello-KH active array element will self assign an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16 (auto-IP). K-framework3 WINDOWS and OSX software K-framework3 Router/Switch with DHCP server Sidebar Toolbar Workspace Menu bar PC/MAC running the K-framework3 software Mugello-KH I User Guide 15 Grouping The working paradigm in the K-framework3 is to group the input and output channels of the active units on the workspace and adjust the system performance within the groups. Groups can be created working both off-line and on-line and are retained by the real units even once unplugged: if a real device belongs to a group, the group is re-created on the workspace during the synchronization process. An active loudspeaker or amplifier might belong to multiple groups sharing its features (eq filters, time delay, volume, etc). Discovery 1. Ensure that the Mugello-KH units and the PC/Mac running the K-framework3 are properly connected to the same network and belong to the same subnet. 2. Power up the Mugello-KH units. 3. Launch the K-framework3. 4. Open the Network window and launch the discovery: • For back compatibility with legacy Mugello-KH units, by default the discovery over the RS485 serial communication is active: in case no legacy Mugello-KH units are present, disable the discovery over the RS485 serial communication. 5. Once discovered, the real units are shown in the left columns, following the order of their ID number; if the workspace contains virtual devices of the same type you can eventually modify the IDs in order to match the units and allows the synchronization. The synchronization can be in either directions: Workspace-to-Real or Real-to- Workspace. Select the sync direction and synchronize all or the single units separately • If the K-framework3 finds two or more devices with the wrong ID, a dialog window appears where unique IDs can be assigned to the units.

{"content": "What element of production is often taken for granted, yet influences the audiences perceptions the most? The sound. Without sound there is no experience. We’ve worked intimately with some of the world’s greatest theatres, to help them to help captivate the audience and bring them into another realm. In keeping with the most beautiful buildings in the world, we’ve designed the most beautiful sound systems. Any permanent audio system must be discreet but simultaneously maintain flexibility to meet the different requirements for the many productions. Our compact speakers have the capability to cover large venues with a minimal amount of elements. K-array’s portfolio also contains some of the most unique solutions that can adapt to the curvature of the stage or the shape of seating for an impressive option for front fill and under balcony fill. We’ve highlighted three favourite theatre projects we’ve been involved with. The Royal Opera House, London The Challenge A professional discreet audio solution that blends seamlessly into its environment to provide an immersive experience without detracting from the surroundings. StageElectrics chose K-array for this exciting project. The Solution The final system, comprises the Python-KP52, precisely colour matched to the gold of the proscenium arch, with 24 KKS50 Compact Sub-Bass in six clusters of four subs, three clusters each side, eight Kobra-KK102 front fills built into the new thrust stage, two Kommander-KA84 four channel amplifiers powering the main proscenium L/R system, a KA84 four channel amplifier powering all six sub bass clusters and a further Kommander-KA24 four channel amplifier powering the front fills. The overall performance of the system, totalling eight KP102s per side, each providing 720W from 12 drivers in each section, suddenly starts to mount up. With 96 3.15inch drivers providing around 5,760W, a dispersion of seven degrees vertical and 100 degrees horizontal and weighing in at 96kg, this becomes a system like no other. One of the truly amazing performance aspects of the system is the image across the room, from sitting in the very first box, round to dead centre, the stereo image is impeccable. Even if you are sitting in the first box house left, you experience a lower level of the left array due to proximity, but you also receive a strong level of house right because the distance allows the system to couple more elements. Combined with the 110 degree horizontal spread, left and right are well balanced. The other benefit of this system is that due to the amount of drivers in the column you are always on axis to the system. This has a dramatic effect on the requirement for under balcony delays and the real experience of sound coming from the stage and not above your head. The Happy Customer “As well as being an opera house, we also host commercial events. And for us, the K-array system covers at least 90/95% of what we want to do. If we were doing Iron Maiden, it would be slightly different, but the chances of that happening are really slim. When you walk into the auditorium, you’ve got the grandiose gold proscenium, rich red plush seats and you’re not expecting to see a loudspeaker hanging above your head. That’s key for us; it’s all about people coming into the auditorium and not seeing a loudspeaker, or not having a sense of the sound being reinforced. For a commercial event, it’s fair enough, but generally, if we’re doing some of the more contemporary operas or ballets which may have electronic instruments as part of the score, you just want that sense of the sound being lifted, but not the sense of it coming from that loudspeaker over there.” Steve Zissler - Sound Director at Royal Opera House Havana Grand Theatre The Challenge Home to the Cuban National Ballet, the theatre required a complete audio renovation. An even and powerful coverage for all seating while maintaining minimal visual impact was the brief. Implemented by installer/distributor All Trading Worldwide. The Solution Using simulation software, the system was designed to have the most even and powerful coverage for all seating while maintaining the lowest visual impact possible. The K-array solution is composed of 8 Python-KP102 line arrays plus a half-metre Python-KP52 loudspeaker arrayed on both sides of the stage opening as the main system supported by four Thunder-KMT18P subwoofers per side. Three Anakonda-KAN200 were chained and implemented under each balcony to reinforce the sound coverage of the first seats closest to the stage that are aligned with the main system. Two Python-KP52 loudspeakers supported by a Thunder-KMT12P subwoofer were set for the same purpose for the upper balcony. Six Anakonda-KAN200+ were installed in front of the stage as front fill powered by a Kommander-KA84 amplifiers. The Budapest Opera House The Challenge Returning the theatre ‘back to the original’ was the brief. Chromosound needed a discreet, high-quality sound system, one that needed to win over the sceptics of those that didn’t believe a speaker system should be used in a traditional opera house. The Solution In a collaboration between Chromasound, Andor Fürjes and Hungarian distributor Audio Partner, a full K-array system of column loudspeakers, subwoofers and amplifiers was specified. The slim form factor of K-array’s column loudspeakers alongside their range of customisable finishes also made them a great fit for this project as they could blend seamlessly into the historic environment. “The National Opera House has quite narrow wall surfaces at the stage opening, so bulky loudspeaker enclosures were not an option for architects” continues Fürjes. “Also, the renovation aimed for a more direct off-the-pit response and less carpeted surface, so the orchestra pit was moved into the audience area by one or two rows, resulting in a significantly larger proscenium stage area. The larger proscenium stage area also meant more potential risk of feedback, if the loudspeakers were to be installed at the stage opening.” Through EASE modelling, Fürjes confirmed the viability of a K-array system leading to the installation of 18 Python and six Kobra line array loudspeakers, driven by Kommander amplifiers. Sub-bass is provided by the Thunder and Rumble series of subwoofers. Describing his design decisions, Fürjes explains, “The main loudspeakers were set to be as high as possible to provide more on-axis response from the stall seats up to the topmost listening positions. Subwoofers were exiled to the upper boxes next to the stage. Some subwoofers are installed below the stall seats floor for a more direct bass response.” Throughout the incredible King’s Red Saloon, fourteen ultra-flat aluminium line array element loudspeakers ensure discreet yet powerful sound. The preservation of the look and feel of the space was of great importance to this project, and the custom finishes offered by K-array helped with this. The Happy Customer \"It was very easy to work with K-array loudspeakers. We were wondering how the custom colours would fit into the environment but on opening the boxes, we saw immediately that the colours were superb and a perfect fit with the space. I especially liked the gold finish on the main PA column in the proscenium, and the tiny red-coloured Vyper loudspeakers, deployed in the corners of the King’s Red Saloon.” Bálint Rédei - Chromasound installation engineer “In the past, I’d had bad experiences with traditional column loudspeakers when trying to sound musical. However, the first listening test of K-array products several years ago convinced me that it is possible to make full musical sound from even tiny-looking enclosures if done properly. The loudspeaker system is visually just as elegant and graceful as it can be in this historical environment. I sincerely hope that at least some of the audience will be wondering where this great sound is coming from.” Andor Fürjes - Sound System Designer", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/show-must-go", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.686846"}, "embedding": null}

Both versions offer multichannel free routing and DSP with features such as grouping, input and output equalizers, level adjustment, dynamic limiters, and 4-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA14 I 4 4 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA34 4 4 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA104 4 4 2500W @ 4Ω 8-channel units analog inputs power output Power Rating per channel Kommander-KA18 8 8 150W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA28 8 8 600W @ 2Ω Kommander-KA68 8 8 750W @ 4Ω Kommander-KA208 8 8 2500W @ 4Ω delay per channel. The key difference between IEB and IEB-pro is the expanded networking capabilities of the IEB-pro. These networking features are compatible with various professional audio protocols for managing digital audio streams, ensuring seamless integration with existing technologies and providing an optimal experience for integrators and system engineers. Network Types and Audio Protocols Standard IEB (Integrated Electronic Brain) The standard IEB includes one network port with fast Ethernet connection (1 Gigabit / 1.000 Mbps) and standard Wi-Fi with an internal access point. Wi-Fi connection can be extended through a router and amplifiers connected in Wi-Fi Client Mode. The physical network connection allows remote control via Ethernet and enables the following physical network topologies: • Standard Star Topology - (Control only - Wi-Fi switched off) • Standard Star topology - Control and DANTE network (primary network without redundancy - Wi-Fi switched off). With a single wired Ethernet connection, both control and audio streams are integrated into the same network flow. IEB-Pro The IEB-Pro is equipped with a 2-port network switch featuring Ethernet connections (1 Gigabit / 1000 Mbps), but does not include Wi-Fi capability. The supported network topologies are as follows: • Star Network Topology - Control only - amplifiers in single- port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante sharing the same network (amplifiers in single-port mode); • Star Network Topology with Control and Dante Redundancy (amplifiers in single port mode - redundancy requires two fully separated networks); • Star Network Topology - with Control and Dante Splitted( amplifiers in single-port mode) - split requires two fully separated networks; • Daisy Chain Network with Control (amplifiers set in bridge- mode) - not recommended for DanteTM. For more information on Dante network topologies and primary/ secondary port configurations, please refer to the dedicated chapter on DANTE network.

Since every host on a network must be identified by a unique IP address, the simplest local network usually implements a router/switch with a DHCP server managing the addresses allocation: by default the Kommander‑KA unit is set to obtain a local IP address from the DHCP server. In case a DHCP server is not present on the LAN, the unit goes in Auto IP mode: in few seconds the amplifier automatically self- assigns an IP address in the range 169.254.0.0/16. A static IP address can be assigned to the amplifier unit using the amplifier’s embedded web app (Network menu). It is possible to connect to the amplifiers wired to the switch via a Wi-Fi access point and configure them using the K-Connect app on a mobile device. Please ensure that the access point is connected to the same local network (LAN) as the switch to allow communication between all devices. When amplifiers are connected to the network via Ethrnet cables, it is recommended to disable the amplifiers built-in Wi-Fi hot- spot.

Kommander-KA User Guide 20 Network topology and network requirements Single Network - Star Topology Control + Digital Audio Streaming A star network configuration for single network amplifiers allows both remote control and digital audio streaming to run over the same network, providing centralized management and high-quality audio distribution. This setup ensures reliable performance and optimal bandwidth allocation for complex audio systems. A. First connect the amplifiers to the switch in a star network configuration and using ETH1 port. B. The same network configuration is used to control the amplifiers and utilize the Digital Audio Stream simultaneously. Single Network - Daisy Chain Control ONLY Daisy chaining network amplifiers allows multiple devices to be connected in daisy chain using a single network cable, streamlining installation and minimizing the need for additional switches. This configuration is ideal for remote control of amplifiers in multi-zone systems; however, it is not recommended for transmitting digital audio streams, as it may restrict bandwidth and degrade signal quality. Connecting the First Amplifier: 3. Connect the EHT1 port of the first amplifier to an external switch or network source. 4. Set the first amplifier to bridge mode. 5. Connect the EHT2 port of the first amplifier to the EHT1 port of the second amplifier. 6. Continue this pattern, connecting the EHT2 port of each amplifier to the EHT1 port of the next amplifier. Kommander-KA+ The Kommander-KA+ are equipped with the IEB-Pro platform, which, as we have seen, includes a switch with 2 ports for Ethernet-wired connections but does not have built-in Wi-Fi. Therefore, the primary access and control methods must be through a local network connected with Ethernet cables to a dedicated switch. • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel. The managing control softwares are the embedded Web- app, K-monitor or K-framework. Network settings (with DanteTM) • First configuration requires connection to ETH1 port on the rear panel • disable the ENABLE AUTOIP function in the network tab. • Avoid Daisy-Chain if working with DanteTM. (Audinate, the manufacturer, does not recommend daisy-chaining through more than two hops, as this can cause latency issues and potentially disrupt the audio stream.) See the DanteReadyTM paragraph to more details. Built-in Wi-Fi is not present on KA+ - direct Wi-Fi connection is not possible - connection via an access point on the same LAN is supported for K-Connect use.

Of course, your computer, mobile or tablet must be connected to the same network as the device you want to control. - Using the K-Connect app for smartphone (click on the World icon next to the device name) - Using the K-Framework 3 discovery function (click on the arrow icon at the end of the row) - Using the K-Monitor discovery function - Typing the IP address of the device in a browser K-array Connect K-framework 3 Dashboard The Dashboard is the landing page where you get when you access the web APP. Here you can: • Reproduce audio files available in the USB pen drive that you have plugged inside the device - Enable the Dante Ready streaming - Manage Device Presets In this section you can also find some informations: - Device model and serial number - FW version - Network address and status - Output channels status Dashboard - Device Preset Starting from the Oskar 1.6.8 you can reorder the presets in the Device Preset section. Just add a number in front of a preset name to place it in the desirable position. Dashboard - Device Preset Preview With osKar 1.7.3 comes a very useful tool, that you can find in the ACTION sub-menu of each device preset. Now you can preview all the settings of a device preset before applying it to your amplifier. Routing In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Routing section and the Output Configuration section The Routing section may differ from device to device, but it usually features a Inpatch, where the available sources can be assigned to the DSP inputs and/or to the Internal player (see the Multiroom chapter later in this document), and a Matrix where the available DSP inputs can be assigned to the device Outputs Because labels are editable, the name will be spreaded across the webapp. Output Configuration In the Audio Configuration Tab you’ll find the Output Configuration section. For each channel, the user must select the proper factory preset, based on the speaker model connected that channel. If the speaker model connected to a channel is a subwoofer, we recommend to complete the match column by specifying the mid-high element used together with the subwoofer. This way, the LP filter on the subwoofer channel will be automatically adjusted to match the frequency response capabilities of the mid-high element. Audio Tools - Levels In the Audio Tools tab, the user can modify input and output Levels and equalizations , as shown in the next page of this document. In addition, is it also possible to set Output Limiters. Audio Tools - Equalizers 8 full parametric filters are available for each output channel. Delay, Polarity, Mute functions are available as well. Filters can be individually bypassed or the entire channel eq can be bypassed clicking on Bypass. Current settings can be copied from one channel to any other using the Copy function. With OsKar 180 we have introduced also 3 full parametric filters for each Input channel. Audio Tools - Limiters Starting with OsKar 178 we have introduced Output Limiters into the WebApp. Is it possible now to set Attack, Hold, Decay and Threshold for each output channel Audio Tools – Floating Meters Since Oskar version 1.6.4, a floating Meters Window is available. It can be accessed in the Audio Tools tab by clicking on the “Show Meters” button, or simply by clicking on the Meters icon on the top right corner of the web APP interface Device discovery and Clone Since Oskar version 1.6.8, a discovery option is available. From any tab you can access it clicking on the “Local Devices” button, then a new section will appear. In this new section you can discover any device connected in the same network and open its webpage just clicking on it. You can also perform some operations on multiple devices at once (power on, standby). You can select two or more devices of the same model to clone the actual amp configuration to the other selected devices. Application settings Since Oskar version 1.6.8 we have added more settings editable by the user. These “Applications Settings” are accessible in two ways: - From the Advanced tab, in the system control window - If you have a remote dongle connected to your Device, you can access its configuration from the “Remote icon” in the top right corner. Application settings In the Settings window you can customize same behaviours of your device: - Enable/Disable the Autoplay on boot option for the Player (off by default ) - Temperature Unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) - Which Volumes you want to control with the K-REMUCTRL remote, if available (Player volume by default) - Remote Button Actions ( PReset Recall, Reset Network, Nothing, Reinstall Firmware ) Application settings - Remote In the remote menu you can decide which volumes are going to be controlled by the K-REMUCTRL, if available. By default the remote controls the volume of the internal player, but you can decide to control multiple input or output DSP volumes. Moreover you can select the db steps for the volume buttons on the remote. Keep in mind that if you select the “keep aligned “ option, all the fader will be set to 0 db then will be controlled from the same starting point. If it is deselected, the volumes will be managed proportionally. Network The Network tab will let you manage the Wifi Hotspot and Ethernet interface settings. K-array devices can generate a WiFi hotspot (Hotspot Mode)or they can be set as clients of an existing WiFi network (Client Mode). Wifi now can also be set in Static IP. Anyway the recommended connection option is over Ethernet. The Ethernet interface can be set in DHCP mode or a static IP address can be specified. Please note that a Gateway must be always specified if the Device is set in static IP mode. Starting from 1.7.2 you can also specify a DNS server, useful in very restrictive network environments Multiroom The new Multiroom feature, introduced with Oskar version 1.6.4, gives you the possibility to stream audio from a device to other devices through the network. Just select one device as a streamer and one or multiple devices as receivers of that streamer. The receivers will reproduce into the media inputs the same music that the streamer is reproducing from the internal player. Multiple devices can be set as streamers in the same network. Before adding a device as a receiver in a multiroom setup, please set its internal player in USB mode in the Dashboard tab. Advanced In the Advanced tab you can - Change the Hostname - Change the Board ID ( useful for the synchronization with K-Framework ) - Country (for your reference) - Update the system OTA or with USB pen drive - Save and Recall Device Presets - Reboot, Standby, Identify the device (status LED turns blue ) and protect with password the web APP so that nobody else have access to it.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/download-file/13961", "content_type": "pdf", "category": "general_info", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.687089"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "USER GUIDE •20230515• Dante Ready implementation on K-array devices Activating Dante Ready KA18 KA28 KA68 KA208 KA14 KA34 KA104 Integrated Electronic Brain Activating Dante Ready User Guide 2 Thank you for choosing this K-array products! To ensure proper operation, please carefully read the owner’s manuals and safety instruction before using the products. After reading this manual, be sure to keep it for future reference. Dante is a proprietary digital media networking solution, developed by Audinate and licensed by K-array, which allows to convey audio content over standard Ethernet networks using the Internet Protocol (Audio over IP). When a K-array device receives Dante audio packets, it reconstructs them back into a continuous digital audio stream, which is then played out. The Dante audio implementation is 100% lossless 24- or 32-bit PCM, 48 kHz sample rate. K-array devices incorporate Dante as an optional software implemented solution, giving the user to get immediate, no- fuss connectivity over IP on demand. Dante Ready Dante Ready allows the user to purchase and add audio channels to a K-array device after initial purchase with easy-to- use software, paying only for as many channels as are required. Dante Controller Dante Controller software allows the user to configure signal routes and other settings. All routes and settings are stored in the individual Dante devices, allowing them to run without any connected computers. Dante Ready Activator scans the local Dante network for any Dante Ready eligible products and shows the available options; purchases are immediately applied to the target devices for a smooth, easy experience. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, Dante Controller must be updated to version 4.5.0.9 or later (February 2022) which includes Dante Ready Activator. Integrated Electronic Brain K-array active devices integrates a new generation intelligence software, named osKar, that allows the user to manage the entire system through various control platforms. With a real quad-core computer and embedded DSP featuring oskar, K-array devices offer enhanced signal processing and managing experience called IEB – Integrated Electronic Brain –giving the user control over the system performance. In order to add channels to a K-array Dante Ready device, osKar must be updated to OS version 1.3.4 or later. K-array Dante Embedded Platforms K-array devices embedding Dante Ready born with no active Dante channels and can be upgraded to 2 IN x 2 OUT Dante channels (Ships with 0x0 / Upgradeable to 2x2).

{"content": "Cleveland, Ohio, USA - The Cleveland Museum of Natural History, founded in 1920, has long been dedicated to the advancement of science, education, research, conservation, and community engagement. Recently, the museum embarked on a significant renovation project, seeking to create an actively sustainable building. To achieve its goals, the museum collaborated with DLR, an architectural firm known for its human-centric approach to design. Key to the client brief was delivering a lighting and audio solution that would be flexible and appropriate for the multi-purpose function of the spaces. Several key areas were identified for the installation, including the public cafe, classrooms, library, and meeting rooms. To address this requirement, DLR reached out to K-array USA, a leading provider of cutting-edge audio solutions. K-array recommended KSCAPE’s RAIL system for its ability to seamlessly integrate with the museum's design while simultaneously delivering professional-quality audio and lighting capabilities. The Rare Books Meeting Room presented unique challenges, particularly concerning video conferencing and voice intelligibility. To address these needs, 12 RAIL systems were positioned horizontally in six rows across the ceiling, optimising voice clarity for participants along the length of the meeting table. A small K-array subwoofer and a KA02 amplifier were discreetly placed under the table, ensuring clear and synchronised audio. In this windowless room, RAIL also provided clear and bright lighting, enhancing the overall ambience. The classrooms, the largest areas to cover, were designed with flexibility in mind. DLR sought to create three learning spaces that could adapt to various teaching styles and demands. The RAIL systems here were flush mounted into the Armstrong suspended ceilings, providing a uniform design and consistent audio coverage. Paired with RAIL’s high-clarity lighting, the result was an immersive learning environment for students. Throughout the project, DLR's commitment to sustainability was evident. The integration of KSCAPE RAIL not only fulfilled the museum's audio and lighting needs but also contributed to its sustainability goals. By choosing RAIL the museum reduced wiring and installation labour by half, improving energy efficiency compared to traditional loudspeaker and lighting designs. In terms of Cleveland Museum’s sustainability goals, RAIL’s integrated Tunable LED lighting system is a highly energy-efficient choice, providing a lumen efficiency score of 98. This high-efficiency results in reduced energy usage and lower costs for the museum. On the importance of this, DLR CEO Steven McKay remarks, “If we don’t design sustainable solutions, we’ll never combat climate change. Somebody has to design them and that is a wonderful burden\" The collaboration between DLR and K-array USA resulted in a successful implementation of the RAIL system at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. By seamlessly blending audio and lighting functionalities, RAIL has proven to provide a smart solution that offers essential audio and lighting whilst improving connectivity and sustainability. If we don’t design the solutions we’ll never combat climate. Somebody has to design them… and that is a wonderful burden", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/cleveland-museum", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.687132"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "A K-array loudspeaker system composed of a long line array of eight Python-KP102 loudspeakers mounted on each side of the proscenium arch at London's Royal Opera House installed by Stage Electrics is so discreet it is almost invisible. Royal Opera House’s Head of Sound, Steve Zissler and his team met with sound designer Jamie Gosney from Stage Electrics and Dave Wooster from 2B Heard to design a system that was adaptable to the theater shows as well as other commercial events hosted in the venue. The final product was the line arrays, precisely color-matched to the gold of the proscenium arch with 24 KKS50 compact sub-bass in six clusters of four subs, three clusters each side, eight Kobra-KK102 front fills built into the new thrust stage, two Kommander-KA84 four-channel amplifiers powering the main proscenium L/R system, a KA84 to power all six sub bass clusters and a further Kommander-KA24 amplifier to power the front fills. The overall performance of the system, providing 720W from 12 drivers in each section from the Pythons on each side, really gains momentum. With 96 3.15” drivers providing around 5,760W, a dispersion of seven degrees vertical and 100 degrees horizontal and weighing in at 96kg, making it a system like no other. As well as being an opera house, we also host commercial events. And for us, the K-array system covers at least 90/95% of what we want to do. If we were doing Iron Maiden, it would be slightly different, but the chances of that happening are really slim. When you walk into the auditorium, you’ve got the grandiose gold proscenium, rich red plush seats and you’re not expecting to see a loudspeaker hanging above your head. That’s key for us; it’s all about is people coming into the auditorium and not seeing a loudspeaker, or not having a sense of the sound being reinforced. For a commercial event, it’s fair enough, but generally, if we’re doing some of the more contemporary operas or ballets which may have electronic instruments as part of the score, you just want that sense of the sound being lifted, but not the sense of it coming from that loudspeaker over there.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/royal-opera-house", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.687147"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "When hosting conferences or events, you need reliable sound that delivers a dynamic and engaging audience experience. It takes specialist expertise to create an auditorium that gives everyone the same high quality of experience, no matter where they are. An auditorium’s purpose is to enable an audience to see and hear and when you get the technology right, it ensures every audience member enjoys the same great experience. Auditoriums have multiple uses and are often also used for musical events, so the same audio system must be adapted to meet the requirements of reproducing high-quality live sound. We love this type of challenge, and we have solutions to fit all sizes and budgets. We’ve rounded up our favourite projects that demonstrate how K-array’s sound can create engaging audience experiences no matter the environment. The Royal Society of Chemistry, London The Challenge Key to the library’s attraction as a venue – prized by users for seminars, conferences, lectures, award ceremonies, fine dining and private functions – is its integrated audio-visual facilities and, taking an opportunity to benefit from the latest technological advancements, the RSC decided to upgrade its audio systems in order to provide better coverage and improved intelligibility to meet the growing requirements of its corporate clients. Previously the venue had issues with dead spots and feedback due to the placement of the speakers, and decided they needed a radically different solution. They were looking for better sound quality because not only does audio technology push forward strongly year to year, but there was a growing demand for a better experience from guests. Lack of visual impact was also a requirement, and there were constraints imposed by the building’s Grade II listed status, meaning that they weren’t able to wall mount the line arrays. The Solution In consultation with the Torpedo Factory Group (TFG) and following an on-site demo from K-array’s UK distributor 2B Heard, the RSC facilities team, headed by Grant Verrell, discussed options for improving audio quality to enhance the venue’s various activities include product launches, presentations, conferences and Q&A sessions. The K-array loudspeaker system was modelled by 2B Heard Director Dave Wooster and designed to provide cohesive full range speech and music reproduction for the large central overhead projector screen and two supplemental HD monitors on either side of the room. The acoustic design instead integrated into custom TFG floor stands housing two Rumble-KU26 subwoofers and supporting a one-metre high Viper-KV52 line array above. This arrangement was replicated on each side of the room giving them a far more cohesive result. In addition, half-metre high Viper-KV25 line arrays were positioned discreetly under the podiums supporting the LCD screens that flank the library. Happy Customer “There’s no latency at all, which is really important when it comes to video conferencing and the sound balances out perfectly,” he added. “Compared to what we had before, it’s phenomenal. We had two different sound structures for the same room – we used to get feedback problems and it was hard to balance the sound out. Sound quality from the K-arrays is honestly second to none from such tiny little speakers that you can barely see. We now have virtual cinema quality sound in a highly flexible event space.The sound quality is honestly second to none from such tiny little speakers that you can barely see. We now have virtual cinema quality sound in a highly flexible event space.” Grant Verrell - Royal Society of Chemistry Facilities Manager Atlanta Hospital Auditorium The Challenge Piedmont Atlanta Hospital is a leader in patient care that has helped the Atlanta community get better and stay well for more than a century. Piedmont Atlanta combines a personalised approach with innovative technologies to deliver treatments that set a new standard for excellence in care. That is a very important criteria for a health facility. The modernity of the building, which sits at street level between the major cross points of the entire campus, features an avant-garde style design with a 40 foot high ceiling and an auditorium space of 45 feet by 90 feet with two walls of full glass. The auditorium is a highly functional, important area for medical conferences in Georgia and the location is idyllic for its vocal source point. The Solution For optimal speech intelligibility ensuring the same listening experience to all 240 audience members, every seat from the first row to the last has its own slim Lyzard-KZ14, this is aided by the design of the conference space to re-create accurate speech performance. To enhance the low-frequency spectrum and add warmth throughout the space, fifteen Truffle-KTR24 are hidden throughout the main audience area. These are reinforced by two Thunder-KMT12P. K-array USA, supported by 1Path, the technology partner designed and installed a conference room that gives a greater focus on the speaker and less aesthetic distractions for an overall improved learning experience Nevada Supreme Court, Las Vegas The Challenge The Nevada Supreme Courthouse in downtown Las Vegas features a 72-seat courtroom with wood panelling, red velvet curtains, and red stadium chairs to give the courtroom a distinctive appearance. Given that audio plays a critical part of court proceedings, the courthouse required a top-grade system that could accommodate good sound reinforcement, audio recording, audio streaming, assisted listening, video teleconferencing and room overflow. The Solution Conference Technologies was brought in to confront the challenge of balancing high-quality audio for both in room and out of room feeds. The local audio system comprised three main zones: the bench, which includes the seven Justices and two clerk locations; the well, which includes the Lectern and attorney table area; and the gallery where the public sits. For the bench area, each of the seven Justices has a Lyzard-KZ14 mini line array. The Lyzard’s were mounted right on the bench and allowed the justices to receive great audio without taking up any working surface. The domed ceiling of the well area made it impossible to utilise ceiling speakers that are typical for this configuration so Conference Technologies installed three colour customised Lyzard-KZ14 loudspeakers and incorporated them into the front of the bench. The end result is that the court is very pleased with the system and has received great feedback from the public and the attorneys that have cases in the Supreme Court. Happy Customer “Challenges arise when you have a large open space that needs efficient audio reinforcement, while providing high quality audio recording, streaming, and far-end audio. By utilising the Lyzard speakers, we were able to achieve a distributed audio system allowing us to raise the audio pick-up on the recording and streaming without sacrificing the in-room sound reinforcement.” Adam Lofredo - Director of Justice of Conference Technologies", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/connecting-audience", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.687164"}, "embedding": null}
{"content": "Alsónémedi is a township of 5,000 residents in the vicinity of Budapest, Hungary where inhabitants have preserved their strong traditions for generations making it a cultural hotspot for both the citizens and visitors from afar. As a top priority, the local government decided to renovate the town's cultural center to provide a new home to the local theater, library and museum. The new theater became the most important aspect during planning with the aim of accommodating the highest level of service for cultural events, concerts and plays which required durable, long-term AV solutions. For the sound system , the township council decided to employ K-array, which fulfilled all the requirements and expectations. In the hall that seats 150, a system of Kobras – both KK52 and KK102 models – were installed and paired with 2 passive Thunder-KMT18P subs, all powered by 2 Kommander-KA24 amplifiers from the technical room. The subwoofers were incased in the wall bordering the stage, while the high-frequency speakers were mounted on the side wall with K-WALL2L wall brackets. The Kobras in SPOT coverage serve the height of both sitting and standing guests, while the 110º horizontal coverage provides balanced direct sound in the entire auditorium. Amplifiers can be accessed via a direct ethernet connection from both the control position and the stage, taking advantage of their Dante compatibility. Next year's plans include the expanding the K-array system to surround sound, for which the cabling arrangements have already been completed.

{"content": "CHALLANGES Introduced to the complete re-fit project by management company Gardiner & Theobald, Richmond-based technology specialist KNEKTD took on Ghazal’s very specific brief for a highly flexible, high quality audio system with minimal visual presence throughout the restaurant. For the focal Brasserie dining space Ghazal wanted to feature a high SPL but intimate central live performance space with the atmosphere of a private nightclub. Having been impressed by the K-array audio system at a private members club in South London, KNEKTD director Shaun Wilson called upon 2B Heard to fulfil the restaurateur’s vision: “With aesthetics and performance firmly at the top of the list we looked for a speaker brand that would help us create the atmospheric mood that Joey had envisaged. I knew from experience that K-array speakers would really suit the space in a way that few other brands could.” Crucially, a prime objective was creating the right aesthetic – making sure that the speakers fitted in well and suited the environment, making them disappear into the room and feel a part of the room so you don’t even notice that they’re there. Finding suitable loudspeaker locations required extensive research, but Dave Wooster’s KF3D K-framework acoustic simulations predicted accurate audio coverage of all areas with a specification based on Kayman, Python, and Vyper line arrays, supplemented with Rumble and Thunder subwoofers. As live music is such a prominent and integral feature of the restaurant experience, a high degree of functionality and interactivity was also necessary to allow sound techs to take full control of the system. THE SOLUTION The Brasserie features a full-on live performance rig with a Yamaha audio console and stage-box augmenting the acoustic drum kit and full complement of Sennheiser microphones and IEMs. All the live and BGM sources play through Kayman-KY102 and Python-KP52 line arrays on custom low-profile wall mounts designed to maintain accurate alignment while being visually discreet. Vyper-KV25 mini line arrays are deployed as in-fills in subtle corner locations. All the speakers are reinforced on the low end by Thunder-KMT218P subwoofers hidden in custom enclosures and an array of Rumble-KU210 subwoofers hidden in the ceiling. In the ground floor Tavern, twin decks and a Pioneer desk are at the front end of the mostly hidden K-array sound system, with the Vyper-KV25 mini line arrays located behind custom fabricated wall grilles and Rumble-KU26 subwoofers providing low end grunt from bespoke floor-mounted cabinets. Downstairs in the secret VIP lounge on the lowest level, accessed only through a mirrored door so you wouldn’t even know it’s there, is an opulent hide-away equipped with a high-SPL DJ system consisting of Python-KP52 line arrays on custom low-profile mounts and under-seating Rumble-KU212 subwoofers that just disappear into the subtly lit highly plush environment. For those with the right credentials and a strong desire for a party scene, it’s a thumping nightclub down there. Even the toilet lobby has been given the full sonic treatment, with custom finish Tornado-KT2 point source satellites covering the space supplemented by Rumble-KU44 subwoofers concealed in the central island. The main speaker systems are mostly powered by Kommander-KA84 Dante-equipped DSP amplifiers located in the lower ground floor rack room, together with an Innosonix MA32/D multi-channel DSP-amplifier with Dante providing power for some of the BGM systems The speakers look great and they suit the space beautifully, which is what the client was really focused on. It’s all about the environment. I’ve really enjoyed working with Joey and I’m really proud to have been part of helping to fulfill his highly imaginative dream. He’s loving the system and it’s working well", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/maine-mayfair", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.687218"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "The Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and all of Russia, a Russian Orthodox bishop and Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, ascended upon the southern port city of Rostov-on-Don for two very important cleric events. During his visit, Patriarch Kirill performed a morning service in the Cathedral of Starocherkasskaya and the following day held mass at the cathedral in Novocherkassk where he also opened the 5th World Congress of Cossacks. The acoustics implemented in the Cathedral of Starocherkasskaya consisted of four Pinnacle-KR102 portable systems to meet the major requirements of a discreet and almost invisible sound system to the clergy, attendees and TV cameras. For the Cathedral of Novocherkassk, another sound system was designed to fulfil two different purposes: provide sound management and reinforcement during the inauguration and liturgy, which were accompanied by two large choirs and broadcasted on TV, and provide conference functionality and sound reinforcement during the Congress which took place following the liturgy. To capture the speech of the Patriarch as well as the delegates of the 5th World Congress of Cossacks, eight Pinnacle-KR102 systems were employed. Monitoring for the clergymen was provided by four white Anakonda-KAN200 were placed along the edge of the chairmen table and hidden within the flower decorations. This project was really important for us. The visit of Patriarch Kirill I was a great event, not only for the southern regions, but for the entire nation. The events were attended by the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church, the members of the regional and federal administration, and many believers. To do our best was fundamental and with K-array we were able to let the general public experience all the beauty and solemnity of the liturgical celebration.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/patriarch-kirill-russia", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.687243"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "Before the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games kicked off in Rio, the Olympic torch made its way throughout Brazil to 300 cities over the course of five months, promoting the spirit and life of games with K-array by its side. Nissan, the official sponsor of Rio 2016, selected K-array to provide audio reinforcement for a mobile stage truck that accompanied the torch throughout its journey for announcements and performances by renowned national and local artists. Rental company responsible for the audio service, Flex Online, installed two Pinnacle-KR402 systems for a total of eight Pythons-KP102 loudspeakers and four Thunder-KMT21 21” subwoofers in the truck. The Python columns were installed horizontally, providing Flex Online with the opportunity to control the sound dispersion, focusing on just the front stage area and not to spread sound to the sides of stage. Nissan also used K-array for various events in connection with the torch relay at their dealerships in many Brazilian cities, with rental company MX Sound Light Design providing several Pinnacle-KR402 portable systems. The torch relay generates a lot of interest at each city or town, and therefore, a very big audience. The horizontal set up was the best way to reach everyone in attendance and increase participation. And they were completely invisible to everyone, which enhanced the performances.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/rio-olympic-torch-relay", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.687253"}, "embedding": null}

{"content": "The Amazonia Live is a social and environmental outreach stemming from the organizers of the Rock In Rio musical festival with the aim to raise awareness of the importance of the Amazon rainorest and to raise funds to recover vegetation. For the opening event the organizers created a floating stage in the form of a leaf in the middle of Negro River where performances by the Amazonas Philharmonic Orchestra, the Amazonas Choir, Sepultura’s guitarist Andreas Kisser, vocalist Ivete Sangalo and tenor Placido Domingo took place. K-array was chosen as the sound reinforcement to provide complete coverage for the 250 invitees and simultaneous live broadcast on TV. Professional audio production and rental company, Gabisom used two Pinnacle-KR202 portable systems to achieve the perfect balance of power and inconspicuousness. Since the show was made for television, the goal was to create a system that sounded great yet had no visual impact.

{"content": "The Park Bosphorus Hotel Istanbul, one of Turkey's most luxurious historic buildings, is a deluxe hotel that boasts the country's largest presidential suite and features intricately designed and decorated dining areas, multi-functional event ballrooms, meeting rooms and, overlooking the Bosphorus River, a 4,500-m² terrace. During renovations, the hotel decided to update its sound system with the very best audio system throughout the entire building. The biggest challenge for distributor Lotus Technologies was working alongside the owners' trusted interior designer who had dismissed a number of audio products previously, however he was immediately drawn to K-array's compact design as well as the sound quality. In the banquet room, 16 Python-KP102 and 36 Kobra-KK52 were installed around the edges of the interiors supported by 8 Thunder-KMT21P, 12 Thunder-KMT12 and 8 Thunder-KMT12P as the subwoofers. The team also installed 40 Anakonda-KAN200 speakers to snakes around the pillars and curves of the room, along with 3 Pinnacle-KR202 systems for DJ setups, speech applications and the conference facilities. The entire room was powered by 4 Kommander-KA84 Class D amplifiers. For the main restaurant, 64 Kobra-KK50W were accompanied by 8 Thunder-KMT12P subwoofers and powered by 3 Kommander-KA84 amplifiers. For the rooftop cafe, 50 Anakonda-KAN200 were installed to hide around the top frame of the open sides to not obtrude the views of the city. The system here was supported by 6 Thunder-KMT12 and 2 Kommander-KA84 amplifiers. The reason why K-array has been installed so often in Istanbul is the clear quality of sound in a compact size, it’s simple yet powerful.

Because the program featured traditional operatic works that were originally created to be naturally-amplified in an enclosed theater, a unique audio system setup and innovative technical strategies were required since the event was hosted en plein air in one of the most fascinating and inaccessible private gardens of Florence. Organizers appointed rental company PowerRent to tackle this challenge with the caveat that the speakers remain invisible and ensure that the difference in amplification go unnoticed. Together with distributor Exhibo, they determined that K-array best fit the needs laid out by the venue and mounted a main LCR system consisting of four line array clusters each with 2 Python-KP102 subtly oriented to generate a sound beam that reached the audience but only marginally touched the stage. Pythons were also responsible for the front fill and side fill, covering the seats closest to the stage and creating spatial effects. Kobra-KK102 line arrays were flown on the towers placed behind the public which generated an extremely natural reverberation and was really almost imperceptible which left a lasting impression. Much of this year’s success is owed to K-array and Exhibo. The quality of the sound equipment has been absolutely wonderful and we will definitely use them next year as well.", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/new-generation-festival", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.687315"}, "embedding": null}

INTRODUCTION KN6 and KN10S are stainless steel, self-powered, 2-way full range speaker systems. Tey are compact and powerful with multiple D class amplifier channels dedicated to each of their transducer elements. KN6 has a wide 130° vertical coverage pattern and the ability to select the horizontal coverage from 10° to 130°, making it usable as both a point source and as a line array element. The system is ideal for medium throw applications in theatres, concert halls, houses of worship and AV installations. KN6 uses two 6” Neodymium cone speakers with 2.5” voice coils for low-mid frequencies. The mid-high frequency section employs three 1” voice coil Neodymium compression drivers. The transducers are optimized with on-board DSP pre-sets. KN6 is designed to easily integrate with KN10s selfpowered subwoofer. The KN10s subwoofer module employs two 10” transducers with Neodymium magnet structure and suspensions engineered for maximum linear excursion. All KN6 and KN10S components are designed by the K-array R&D department and custom made under the K-array quality control system.

SAFETY • It is important that loudspeaker systems are used in a safe manner. • Professional loudspeakers are capable of producing extremely high sound levels and should be used with care. Hearing loss is cumulative and can result from levels above 90dB if people are exposed for an extended period. • Never stand close to loudspeakers driven at high level. • Suspending the system should only be done by qualified personnel following safe rigging practices. Secure fixings to the building structure are vital. Seek help from architects, structural engineers or other specialists if in any doubt. • Do not operate the speaker for an extended period of time with the sound distorting. This is an indication of malfunction, which in turn can cause heat to generate and result in a fire. • Connect the power supply only to an appropriate power adapter. • Do not install the speaker in wet or humid locations without using weather protection. • Do not allow water or any foreign object to get inside the speaker. Do not put objects containing liquid on, or near, the unit. • To reduce the risk of overheating the amplifier, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight. Do not install the unit near heat emitting appliances, such as a room heater or stove. • No naked flame sources such as lighted candles should be placed near the device. • The speaker should be placed so that its location does not interfere with its proper cooling. • Do not attempt to disassemble the unit. The unit contains no user serviceable parts. Repairs should be performed only by factory trained service personnel. • Be sure that the adapter has the correct voltage value.

AMPLIFIER 8.1 AC POWER CONNECTOR 8.2 VOLTAGE REQUIREMENT 8.3 CURRENT REQUIREMENT The amplifier module and the rest of the audio equipment connected to it (mixing consoles, processors, etc.) must be connected to the AC power distribution in a proper way, preserving AC line polarity and connecting earth ground such that all grounding points are connected to a single node or common point using the same cable gauge as the neutral and line(s) cables. Bad grounding connections between speakers and the rest of the audio system may produce noise, hum and/or serious damage to the input/output stages in the system’s electronic equipment. Before applying AC to any K-array self-powered speaker, be sure that the voltage potential difference between neutral and earth ground is less than 5 VAC. KN6/KN10S operates safely and without audio discontinuity if the AC voltage stays within a operating window from 90 V to 260 V. Check the voltage before connecting the amplifier to the AC power. A higher voltage could seriously damage the device. The KN6/KN10S presents a dynamic load to the AC mains, which causes the amount of current to fluctuate between quiet and loud operating levels. Since different cables and circuit breakers heat up at varying rates, it is essential to understand the types of current ratings and how they correspond to circuit breaker and cable specifications. The maximum continuous RMS current is the maximum RMS current in a period of at least ten seconds. It is used to calculate the temperature increase in cables, which is used to select cables that conform to electrical code standards. It is also used to select the cable size and gauge and the rating for slow-reacting thermal breakers. The maximum burst RMS current is the maximum RMS current in a period of ap­ proximately one second. It is used to select the rating for magnetic breakers. The maximum instantaneous peak current during burst is used to select the rating for fast reacting magnetic breakers. 13 rev.A KN6 - KN10S For best performance, the AC Cable voltage drop should not exceed 10% at 115V and 5% at 230V. The minimum electrical service amperage required by a K-array Skin system is the sum of their maximum continuous RMS current. We recommend allowing an additional 30% above the minimum amperage to prevent peak voltage drops at the service entry. 140VA(>10 sec) - 700VA (<1 sec) autorange KN6/KN10S max continuous apparent power (VA) 8.4 REAR PANEL 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 14 13 12 11 3 4 1.

The white PowerCon connector is a parallel OUTPUT for supplying power to other devices (max 16A supported). When AC power is applied to the speaker, the auto-range power supply selects automatically the correct operating voltage. For creating your power cables, please use the following wiring diagrams: The Audio section includes a female balanced XLR connector and a male XLR connector wired in parallel. Thanks to these connectors it is possible to feed a module and to send the same signal to another one through the LINK connector. It is possible to connect till 30 different modules in parallel on the same balanced line (with a source of 600 ohm output impedance). A Level Control potentiometer (PAD) allows different set levels.

KN6: 2 x 250W class D amplifier channel + 2 x 20W class A/B amplifier channel KN10S: 2 x 250W class D amplifier channel All the specific functions for the KN6 or KN10S such as crossovers, frequency, phase response, and driver protection are determined by a DSP processor installed inside the amplifier. The devices have three different type of audio signal limiter. The Clip limiter, the average Power limiter and the High Frequency limiter reduce the risk of damaging the components of the speakers. A Peak Current Shut Down acts as output stage switching process inhibition that resets itself after 2 seconds. The tripping point is at 35A. A temperature protection acts reducing the output stage gain above temperature level of 85° (temperature on output power devices proximity). The internal DSP allows to choice between four different default presets. 8.7 AMPLIFICATION AND PROTECTION CIRCUITRY 8.8 DSP SLOT KN6 KN10S 1 KN6 narrow KN10S 2 KN6 wide KN10S EXT 3 KN6 narrow MH KN10S 150 Hz 4 KN6 wide MH KN10S 150 Hz EXT 16 rev.A KN6 - KN10S 0 20 50 1K 2K 5K 10K 20K 100 200 500 3 -3 -6 -9 -12 6 9 12 KN6 narrow KN6 wide 0 20 50 1K 2K 5K 10K 20K 100 200 500 3 -3 -6 -9 -12 6 9 12 KN6 narrow MD KN6 wide MD 10° 130° LINE ARRAY POINT SOURCE Spot Flood 17 rev.A KN6 - KN10S 0 20 50 1K 2K 5K 10K 20K 100 200 500 3 -3 -6 -9 -12 6 9 12 KN10S 0 3 -3 -6 -9 -12 6 9 12 KN10S 150Hz KN10S 150Hz EXT KN10S EXT 0 20 50 1K 2K 5K 10K 20K 100 200 500 3 -3 -6 -9 -12 6 9 12 0 20 20 50 50 1K 1K 2K 2K 5K 5K 10K 10K 20 20 K K 100 100 200 200 500 500 3 -3 -6 -9 -12 6 9 12 18 rev.A KN6 - KN10S 9.

{"content": "Today, nightclubs audio systems aren’t just focused on “louder and more bass”. The requirements have changed; clear and easy to use nightclub sound systems are now expected, with cleverly-zoned audio systems, creating different moods or using sound treatment in different rooms - the discerning listeners expect to hear crystal clear audio, as well as thumping bass. This is what will help you elevate your guest experience and stand out from the crowd. Our K-ecosystem designs acoustic systems of high-quality and flexibility for lounges and clubs. The powerful, yet fast and controlled sound that the speakers make pulses through the veins and literally punches the air with vigour, whilst harmonising with any adjoining areas with different audio requirements. These reliable solutions can go night after the night without relenting. We’ve rounded up three of our favourite club and lounge projects we’ve been involved with. Iris Nightclub, Dubai The Challenge Iris bars can be found in the world's gateway cities. They are modern lounge bars delivering an elegant, natural, sensuous and free-spirited experience. Since the launch in Beirut in 2010, they have been a hot spot for memorable DJ events, cocktails and high profile parties. Iris recently opened a new site in Meydan, Dubai. With many signature traits, there is one universal key ingredient contributing factor to Iris' major success - great sounding audio. Procom Middle East, our local distributor, handled the complete audio integration from design to execution and technical support, and like the other locations around the world, the venue called on K-array to meet their high expectations. The venue goes beyond the typical late-night DJ sets and provides both a Friday brunch service and live band music at various times, all of which provide a different set of requirements for the audio system. “We had to create an audio system that could cater to in excess of 2,000 customers that offered enough power and punch for an outdoor venue while still remaining in control of many additional factors such as noise pollution and key design elements” The large open-air space is an unusual shape and is divided into several sections with seating spread all around. There are five bars, high tables, lounges and two areas reserved for VIPs – all centred around a centralised view of downtown Dubai and the Burj Khalifa. Iris suffers from extra restrictive noise regulations. As such, Procom had to pay extra attention in the design to limiting outside transmission: the system was designed by very carefully taking into account noise restrictions in the area, installing a system that has all the coverage and power requirements of a club installation and yet still meet the noise restriction requirements of the area. The Solution K-array’s Dragon-KX12 cabinet was central to the project. Outputting up to 132dB, Dragon provided amble SPL for the Iris lounge and ticked all of the boxes in terms of its compact size and sleek aesthetic. The floor area and main bar installed four pairs of Dragon-KX12 finished in black to match the venue’s trademark pillars. These were paired with 18-inch Thunder-KMT18 subwoofers tucked out of sight. The four additional sidebars were fitted with five Dragon-KX12 and five Thunder-KMT218. The Python-KP52 column loudspeaker was also wall-mounted to provide additional coverage. The large VIP section features twelve Python-KP52 spread uniformly throughout. Four Thunder-KMT18 subwoofers generated the necessary low-end for this area. Away from the main rooftop, Procom integrated twelve Tornado-KT2C speakers into the ceiling for the wine cellar. Iris Dubai’s expansion has seen a complete new indoor venue with sound, light and video. Eighteen Dragon-KX12 passive speakers along with five Thunder-KMT21 and eight Thunder-KMT218 active subs were installed throughout the venue. All controlled by Symetrix, using Prism 8×8 digital signal processor, a control server and xControl external control expander. The DJ monitor system consisted of two Thunder-KMT21 and two Dragon-KX12 passive speakers. The Happy Customer “Noise requirements, level checks, and site readings were taken and used regularly during the design process to ensure the neighbouring residential areas would not be disturbed. As with the previous locations, the Iris management could not be happier with the work done by Procom.” Wassim Zouein - Iris’ Operations Manager 12 Stories at InterContinental, DC The InterContinental Hotel in Washington D.C.’s new billion-dollar residential and retail development, The Wharf, boasts a 3,500-square-foot rooftop cocktail spot, dubbed 12 Stories. The drinking destination marks the D.C. debut for Gerber Group, the prominent owner-operator behind the trendiest bars and restaurants in New York, Atlanta and Santiago, Chile. Designed by interior designers SLDesign, 12 Stories features modern artwork by Paige Smith, industrial-chic design touches like concrete flooring, wired pendulum lighting, velvet, marble, leather and wood furniture, and an expansive 26-foot NanaWall, opening up onto an outdoor terrace. The Solution The Gerber Group requested an audio system from longtime partner integrator Global Audio Systems – who had already found success installing K-array in Gerber Group's Grand Central Station lounge, The Campbell – a system that could deliver a high SPL in a compact enclosure. Together with hotel management, the team selected K-array’s Kayman-KY102 line array loudspeakers for its amazing horizontal coverage and its 4” closely-spaced drivers that allowed for better frequency response in the lower bandwidth. Given its similar characteristics yet in a smaller frame, the Python-KP52 was also selected for distribution throughout the venue. The Gerber Group and InterContinental Hotel were ecstatic with the sound and look of the final system, which is composed of 7 Kaymans and 4 Pythons. The Happy Customer “It sounds amazing, this was the right decision.” Gerber Group spokesperson Noi Bar, Delhi The Challenge NOI is the nouveau high-energy lounge/bar located at the most luxurious mall, The Chanakya, in Delhi with an inhouse DJ that transforms the locale into a nightly hot spot. The client, real estate moguls DLF India, took the project to system integrator Macbee to produce the best sounding bar in Delhi. The interior designer Rockwell Group USA required an completely discreet audio system without any acoustic treatment to not disturb the high-end interior concept. The seating at the bar and in the courtyard was also a challenge, positioned very close to the walls so any surface installation could cause a poor experience for those close to the speakers rather than in the middle of the areas. The Solution With these requirements, Macbee wanted to take advantage of SPL consistency from a line array setup even though most bars and clubs in Delhi employ point sources. The only product which could fit their design and meet both demands was K-array with their small footprint and Pure Array Technology. For the bar, a system consisting of 4 Python-KP102 line arrays, 2 Thunder-KMT18P subs and 4 Rumble-KU212 subs were installed and powered by a Kommander-KA84 amplifier. Eight Python-KP102 line arrays, 2 Thunder-KMT18P subwoofers and 4 Rumble-KU212 subs powered by a Kommander-KA84 amp were installed in the double-height courtyard. Four Python-KP52 loudspeakers paired with 2 Thunder-KMT12P subs powered by a Kommander-KA24 amp for the outdoor lounge. The speakers were placed in the corners and the subs were set behind the seating with two in the courtyard area ceiling, so they were completely hidden but yet able to give the low energy required for the weekends when there are around 500-600 people and the bar turns into a nightclub. The Happy Customer “We were able to achieve a very high seat-to-seat consistency in terms of smooth bass response as well as SPL. The most amazing response from the management was that they were able to sit right next to the speaker and still have a conversation. Not only were we able to just achieve - we exceeded the clients’ and designers’ expectations both in terms of performance and looks using K-array unique audio solutions. This place is now one of the top 3 places in New Delhi.” Sawan Nichani - Sound Consultant, Macbee", "meta": {"source": "https://www.k-array.com/en/post/great-sound-system", "content_type": "html", "category": "news", "crawled_at": "2025-06-20T15:01:03.687396"}, "embedding": null}

The amount of energy sent towards the ceiling and the floor is then minimized greatly improving intelligibility in highly reverberant environments like houses of worship and conference rooms. Furthermore, such a focused sound beam is able to cover a long distance uniformly. The audience located in front of the array and at the back of the venue will experience the same tonal balance without the need for several delay lines. With no horns and no waveguides, PAT columns can be joined to create longer arrays. The longer the array, the narrower the sound beam and the further the distance that can be covered uniformly. watch the animation 10 11 Premium Materials & Finishes K-array utilizes the most durable and resistant materials when developing our products to offer the most reliable solutions on the market. Weather resistant speaker systems made of aluminum and steel make up the frame of all products within the K-array portfolio.

That is why we consciously decided to develop unparalleled premium speakers that made life easier while putting a smile on the face of those who love and appreciate excellent sound. LIVE PRO SOUND 52 53 It’s well known that a good perception of the low frequencies during a live event is the key for a great musical experience. Our new approach to the design of concert sound systems, guarantees an optimal control of the bass distribution over the audience areas, minimizing the SPL variations in the very critical octave 60-120 Hz. Electronic Beam Steering Advanced Bass Control Composed of closely-spaced, full- range sound sources, all our line array elements feature our innovative Pure Array Technology (PAT). With no drivers dedicated to the high frequencies, no bass reflex or passive radiators dedicated to the low end, there are no crossover points and a perfect phase response is achieved in both the near and far fields. All the sound sources in the array are identical and perfectly coupled producing a true line array with benefit of having the sound beam radiated by the column very wide on the horizontal plane and very narrow on the vertical plane. The amount of energy sent towards the ceiling watch the animation watch the animation watch the animation Family Products Pag Firenze 88 Family Products Pag Pinnacle 56 Thunder 72 Firenze 88 Family Products Pag Mugello 80 Firenze 88 Practicality in transporting, ease of assembly and cost savings aren’t the only benefits of K-array’s unique technology, Slim Array Technology (SAT). One of the biggest advantages of SAT line arrays is that they show a cardioid dispersion pattern in the mid-low range, where conventional line arrays are almost omnidirectional. This reduces the amount of energy sent towards the stage which typically requires a high volume level of the monitors for the musicians even though it consequently deteriorates the signalto-noise ratio of the microphones and increases the difficulty in feedback management. Another advantage of SAT is a better impulse response than that of a conventional line array element. In truth, a directly-radiating bass reflex box uses a resonant air volume that tends to reduce the definition in the low-mid range and does not allow the correct reproduction of fast transients. Instead, SAT’s compact design allows sound to exit instantaneously without resonance, generating a significant amount of sound pressure in the low and low-mid range with a fast transient response. The cardioid dispersion in the low frequencies and an extremely fast impulse response are the true advantages of slim array speakers. The combination of these two factors leads to a significantly better acoustic outcome with respect to the traditional line array elements, particularly in terms of sound definition and noise pollution outside the desired audience areas. Additionally, the compactness of the speakers benefits the user through the practicality in transporting, the ease of assembly and the overall minimal footprint of the cluster which creates an optimization of space, time and, therefore, total incurred costs for the management of these systems.
