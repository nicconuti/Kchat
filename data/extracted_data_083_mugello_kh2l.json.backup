    "description": "The Mugello-KH2 I is an incredibly flat and lightweight, self-powered speaker, part of K-array's Mugello Series. It features two 8” neodymium magnet woofers and two compression drivers, powered by a four-channel Class-D amplifier module delivering 1500W per channel. This allows it to drive up to three Mugello-KH2P I passive line array elements. The speaker utilizes Slim Array Technology for improved impulse response and a unique cardioid polar pattern across its frequency range. It also incorporates K-array's Electronic Beam Steering technology, which, along with mechanical steering, enables digital adjustment of sound beam dispersion for precise sound field aiming. This product is DISCONTINUED.",
