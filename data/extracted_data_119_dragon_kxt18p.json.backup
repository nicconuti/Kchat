    "description": "The Dragon-KXT18P is a high-performance passive full-range point source element. It features an 18\" neodymium magnet woofer, a 4\" compression driver (MF), and a 2.5\" compression driver (HF). It has a frequency response of 48 Hz - 18 kHz (-6dB) and a maximum SPL of 144 dB (peak) half-space. The rated power is 1600W (LF) + 380W (MHF) bi-amplified, with a coverage of V. 40° - H. 60° (Rotatable w/ screws). The dimensions are 650 x 735 x 580 mm (25.6 x 28.9 x 22.8 in) and it weighs 40.8 kg (89.84 lbs). It is made of birch plywood and is available in black or custom RAL colors. It has an IP43 rating.",
