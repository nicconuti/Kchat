    "description": "The Mugello-KH3P I is an incredibly flat and lightweight passive speaker, a revolutionary compact line array element for large-scale concerts and live events. It features two 12” neodymium magnet woofers and two compression drivers. The speaker utilizes Slim Array Technology for improved impulse response and a unique cardioid polar pattern across its frequency range. It also incorporates K-array's Electronic Beam Steering technology, which, along with mechanical steering, enables digital adjustment of sound beam dispersion for precise sound field aiming.",
