It is designed to combine with mid-high speakers to provide a full-range frequency response with high output in a virtually invisible profile. It is entirely made of steel, making it resistant to tough weather conditions, ideal for aquatic environments. A MARINE version with higher salt corrosion treatments is available on request. K-ARRAY Kommander amplifiers are recommended for optimal performance with Rumble subwoofers.",
