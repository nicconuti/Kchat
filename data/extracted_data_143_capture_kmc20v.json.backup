    "description": "The Capture-KMC20V is an incredibly thin line array microphone with 8 x 4 mm cardioid capsules and a brass base, designed for vertical setup. This configuration allows for wide horizontal and narrow vertical sound registration. It can be tilted from 90° to 145° relative to the base surface, with a 28° truncated vertical orientation. A 4.75 mm-thick HT800 silicone anti-vibration pad is attached to the base to minimize noise transmission from the surface to the microphone array.",
