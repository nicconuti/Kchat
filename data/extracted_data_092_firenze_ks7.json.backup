    "description": "The Firenze-KS7 is a 2 x 21” subwoofer featuring neodymium magnets with 6” voice coils driven by powerful Class D amplifiers. The large ports are designed to be fully symmetrical to the speakers, which means the back loading on the drivers is consistent and even with no port air turbulence. The rear panel provides balanced analog and digital AES3 inputs and Ethernet connectivity for complete remote control over the fully-featured integrated DSP. With the Firenze-KS7, gradient/cardioid configurations and end-fire arrangements are made easy with up to 2 seconds of input delay and frequency shaping. The Firenze-KS7 is an all-encompassing subwoofer that is capable of being employed as a single point source or in an arch array configuration.",
