    "description": "The Pinnacle-KR804P II is an advanced audio system that combines the Thunder-KS4P dual 18\" subwoofer with the Kayman-KY102 column, powered by the Kommander-KA208LIVE amplifier. It is designed for large-scale applications such as outdoor concerts, large auditoriums, and nightclubs, offering superior sound quality and expansive coverage with Pur Array Technology. The system is also built for scalability and modularity. This system is controllable via the DSP functionalities of the Kommander-KA208 processing platform, with a dedicated K-array Connect mobile app for remote control and DSP parameter adjustments. K-framework3 software is available for designing and managing multiple units over a wired LAN.",
