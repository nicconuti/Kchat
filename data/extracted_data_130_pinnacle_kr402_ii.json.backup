    "description": "The Pinnacle-KR402 II system combines one Thunder-KS3 I self-powered subwoofer, one Thunder-KS3P I passive subwoofer, and four Python-KP102 I stainless steel line array elements with 3.15” drivers. The self-powered Thunder-KS3 I subwoofer with DSP is designed to be the core device in the sound reinforcement system: the dedicated K-array Connect mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for the remote control, the DSP parameters and to boost the system performance. K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units over a wired LAN in demanding applications. This results in a lightweight, flexible, and elegant portable system, delivering pristine sound in various applications.",
