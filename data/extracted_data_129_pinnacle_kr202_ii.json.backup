    "description": "The Pinnacle-KR202 II is composed of: 1x Thunder-KS2 I self-powered subwoofer, 1x Thunder-KS2P I passive subwoofer, 4x Kobra-KK102 I pure 2\" line array column, 4x K-JOINT3, 2x K-FOOT3. The self-powered Thunder-KS2 I subwoofers with DSP are designed to be the core devices in the sound reinforcement system: the dedicated K-array Connect mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for the remote control, the DSP parameters and to boost the system performance. K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units over a wired LAN in demanding applications. This results in a lightweight, flexible, and elegant portable system, delivering pristine sound in various applications like lounge parties, private events, restaurants & cafes, yachts, and houses of worship.",
