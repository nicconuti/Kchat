    "description": "The Domino-KF26 is the smallest of the full-range Domino line measuring a depth of less than 12 cm. Compact and discreet, the Domino-KF26 is a stainless steel speaker with plug-and-play capabilities and it is the perfect solution for applications with subwoofer restrictions. The Domino-KF26 doesn't require a dedicated preset and it can be driven by any amplifier. Designed as a passive speaker, the Domino-KF26 can be transformed into a self-powered speaker just by inserting the specific amplifier accessory. With a peak SPL of 115dB, the KF26 is ideal for smaller installations that require high quality in a practical, compact form.",
