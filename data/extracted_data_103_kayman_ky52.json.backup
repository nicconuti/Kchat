    "description": "The Kayman-KY52 is the widest line array in our product collection, a passive speaker comprised of four closely-spaced 4” neodymium magnet woofers. A true line array, the KY52 has a variety of rigging accessories to offer different linking and hanging options for vertical and horizontal line array configurations. For easier use and integration with other speakers or amplifiers, the KY52 features two different impedance values (4Ω – 16Ω). All Kayman-KY52 components are designed by the K-array R&D department and are custom-made under the K-array quality control system in Italy.",
