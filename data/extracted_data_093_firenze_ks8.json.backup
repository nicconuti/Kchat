    "description": "The Firenze-KS8 is a compact, self-powered, weather resistant subwoofer providing an exceptional peak output of 148 dB SPL. The KS8 features IPAL® technology, including a powerful amplifier module, a differential pressure sensor, a “zero latency” DSP and two 21” specifically designed high-efficiency transducers. The Firenze-KS8 is also integrated in the simulation software EASE Focus to give endless possibilities of configurations like cardioid, virtual arc, and/or whatever the venue will require.",
