It features two 8” neodymium magnet woofers and two compression drivers. It utilizes Slim Array Technology for improved impulse response and a unique cardioid polar pattern across its frequency range. It also incorporates K-array's Electronic Beam Steering technology, which, along with mechanical steering, enables digital adjustment of sound beam dispersion for precise sound field aiming. This product is DISCONTINUED.",
