    "description": "Dolomite-KRD202P sets a new benchmark in high-performance portable audio systems. Each full-range tower integrates 32x 2\" drivers with Pure Array Technology (PAT), paired with 4x 10\" subwoofers and 4x 10\" passive radiators, housed in modular 1-meter sections for scalable and flexible deployment. Sold as a stereo kit, the system includes 2-meter towers per side, dedicated mounting hardware, a ground-stacking base, and the KA104LIVE amplifier. By combining array drivers, subwoofers, and passive radiators within a single tower body, the system achieves a highly linear and accurate frequency response, making it ideal for long-throw applications. The passive radiators enhance low-end performance by increasing perceived bass volume and system efficiency without adding bulk or requiring more power — making it a true full-range solution for premium audio applications. Built for durability, each module features a weather-resistant stainless steel frame wrapped in acoustically transparent fabric, combining ruggedness with a refined aesthetic. The modular design allows for compact or large-scale configurations, adapting seamlessly to premium environments—from luxury private events to hospitality venues and high-end residential settings.",
