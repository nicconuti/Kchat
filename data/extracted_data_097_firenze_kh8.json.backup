    "description": "The Firenze-KH8 is a powerful, top-of-the-line touring system featuring Slim Array Technology (SAT) and Electronic Beam Steering (EBS). Self-powered and weather resistant, the KH8 produces an exceptional peak output of 145 dB SPL and is fully controlled by 8 onboard DSPs for maximum operational flexibility offering a unique solution to the live sound market. The state-of-the-art rigging system allows you to pre-cable stacks of 3 units to fly a straight 24-unit cluster in less than 10 minutes. This is possible because it is not necessary to dismount the entire cluster: the speakers are anchored in groups of three within rigid frames that can be connected quickly to create longer clusters. Compared to traditional systems that require wiring and a mechanical connection for each speaker, the KH8 cuts down on time for a cost-sensitive solution. Our Firenze-KH8 is a powered IP45 system with an integrated IP65 electronic enclosure, to resist even heavy rain.",
