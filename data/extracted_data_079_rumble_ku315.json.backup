    "description": "The Rumble-KU315 is a passive subwoofer from K-array's Rumble series, featuring a nominal rated power of 2000 W at 4 Ω. It is constructed from water-resistant polyurea-coated birch plywood and includes a 15\" neodymium transducer along with two additional 15\" passive radiators, which help ensure linear transducer excursion and minimal residual noise. This design, combined with durable materials and an upgraded SpeakOn NL4 connector, makes it suitable for outdoor installations and resistant to harsh weather conditions. The Rumble-KU315 is designed for medium and large-format projects such as clubs, lounges, theaters, cinemas, and auditoria, offering an extended frequency response and high output in a discrete form factor. K-array's Kommander amplifiers are recommended for powering the Rumble-KU315, as they can balance settings to match other K-array mid-high speakers.",
