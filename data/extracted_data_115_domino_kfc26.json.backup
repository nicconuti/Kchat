    "description": "The Domino-KFC26 is a 2 x 6\" full-range, wide-coverage passive speaker. It has a peak SPL of 115dB and fixed 8Ω impedance, making it suitable for home cinema applications and situations requiring wider audio coverage, such as ceiling mounting. The speaker maintains the compact, discreet stainless steel chassis of the Domino-KF26 and does not require a dedicated preset, allowing use with any well-scaled amplifier. It can be transformed into a self-powered speaker by inserting a specific amplifier accessory.",
