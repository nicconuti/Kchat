    "description": "The Rumble-KU212 is an ultra-thin, high-power passive subwoofer from K-array. It features a 12” neodymium transducer and a 12” passive transducer, making it resistant to dust, sand, and water. The subwoofer is made entirely of steel, enhancing its durability, even in harsh weather conditions, and is suitable for aquatic environments. A Marine version with higher salt corrosion treatments is available upon request. The KU212's neodymium transducer has a double voice coil, offering two selectable impedance settings (4-16 Ω), allowing up to four units to be combined with a single amplifier channel at 4Ω. K-ARRAY Kommander amplifiers are recommended for optimal performance. All components are designed and custom-made by K-array in Italy.",
