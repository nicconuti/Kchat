    "description": "The Mugello-KH3 I is a medium-format line array with digital steering, which is now discontinued. It is an incredibly flat and lightweight self-powered speaker, part of the K-array Mugello Series. It features two 12” neodymium magnet woofers and two compression drivers. A single active Mugello-KH3 I can drive up to three passive Mugello-KH3P I elements due to its powerful four-channel Class-D 1500W @ 4Ω amplifier module with DSP. The Mugello-KH3 I utilizes Slim Array Technology for better impulse response and a unique cardioid polar pattern across its frequency range. It also incorporates K-array's Electronic Beam Steering technology, allowing digital adjustment of sound beam dispersion for precise sound field aiming.",
