    "description": "The Anakonda-KAN200 is a light-weighted, revolutionary speaker that can take any form. These loudspeakers are 2 meters long with 8 x 1\" drivers that deliver a max power of 300W at 64Ω impedance. Integrated male and female Speakon NL4 connectors hide all connections inside the body of the speaker. By using two amplifier channels with the dedicated K-ANLINK accessory, you can extend your Anakonda system to up to 32 units – 64 meters – which creates an elegant, seamless line of continuous sound. Its dedicated presets work on a wide frequency range and can be used as an audio system in combination with K-array subwoofers.",
