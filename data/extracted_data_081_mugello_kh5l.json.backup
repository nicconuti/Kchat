    "description": "The Mugello-KH5 I is a revolutionary compact line array element for large-scale concerts and live events. This self-powered speaker is comprised of two 15” neodymium woofers and four horn loaded compression drivers with 2.5” voice coil in a shallow box frame. The four-channel Class-D amplifier module with DSP delivers 1500W @ 4Ω per channel providing unique power and control for sound aiming and fine tuning. The Slim Array Technology of the Mugello-KH5 I allows for a better impulse response and guarantees unique cardioid polar pattern over its entire frequency range. Along with the mechanical steering, K-array's Electronic Beam Steering technology gives the Mugello-KH5 I the ability to digitally adjust the dispersion of the sound beams to ensure the perfect aiming of the sound field. This product is DISCONTINUED.",
