    "description": "The KX12F is a coaxial point-source speaker, featuring a 12” woofer and a 1.7” compression driver. This new iteration pushes the iconic KX12 to even greater performance levels, delivering a peak SPL of 134 dB and a rated power of 1200W. It combines immense power with compactness, making it a perfect match for the Firenze family, and fully compatible with the Firenze-KH7P line array. Built with a durable stainless steel cabinet and the signature wide-mesh grille, the KX12F houses an adjustable waveguide that allows for precise vertical and horizontal coverage. This flexibility enables coverage angles to be adjusted from 30° to 90°, providing tailored sound dispersion to suit various venues and applications. Whether used as a standalone speaker or in conjunction with the Firenze-KH7P line array, the KX12F enhances both the frequency response and the overall performance of the system. Its reliability and power make it ideal for high-performance sound applications. It is particularly well-suited for DJ monitoring or distributed sound systems in clubs and dancefloor environments.",
