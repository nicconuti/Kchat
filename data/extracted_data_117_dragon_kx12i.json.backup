    "description": "The Dragon-KX12 MKI is a radical reinterpretation of a coaxial point source speaker, featuring a 12” woofer and a 1.7” compression driver. Designed to improve high-quality audio, it performs with remarkable versatility, whether used as a powerful point source or as part of a line array. The MKI version introduces a sleek stainless steel chassis with a compact and lightweight design, perfect for both durability and ease of installation, simplifying rigging. The KX12 MKI rises to the challenges of high-intensity applications, such as DJ monitoring in exclusive venues. Its fixed waveguide can be rotated using screws allowing for focused or spread horizontal and vertical coverage of V. 40° | H. 60°, optimizing sound dispersion and ensuring superior performance. When used in an array, the speaker fully leverages EBS (Electronic Beam Steering) technology for precise, electronically adjustable coverage, offering consistent and controlled sound distribution.",
