    "description": "The Pinnacle-KR102 II system combines two 12\" subwoofers (Thunder-KS1 I + Thunder-KS1P I) with two Kobra-KK102 I pure array column loudspeakers. The self-powered Thunder-KS1 I subwoofer drives both the Kobra-KK102 I and a separate passive column system made with the Thunder-KS1P I subwoofer. The Thunder-KS1 I subwoofer with DSP is designed to be the core device in the sound reinforcement system, with the K-array Connect mobile app providing a user-friendly interface for remote control, DSP parameters, and system performance boost. This results in a lightweight, flexible, and elegant portable system, delivering pristine sound in various applications like lounge parties, private events, restaurants & cafes, yachts, and houses of worship.",
