    "description": "The K-array Pinnacle-KR404P II system is composed of two Thunder-KS4P I passive subwoofers, eight Python-KP102 I stainless steel line array elements with 3.15\" drivers, and one Kommander-KA208LIVE amplifier. The Kommander-KA208LIVE amplifier with DSP is designed to be the core device in the sound reinforcement system: the dedicated K-array Connect mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for the remote control, the DSP parameters and to boost the system performance. K-framework3 is the managing and control software dedicated to professionals and operators looking for a powerful tool for designing and managing a large number of units over a wired LAN in demanding applications. This results in a lightweight, flexible, and elegant portable system, delivering pristine sound in various applications.",
