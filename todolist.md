## Development Guidelines

### Before Starting Development
1. Review the current codebase architecture in `CLAUDE.md`
2. Run existing tests to ensure baseline functionality: `pytest`
3. Check code quality: `ruff .` and `mypy .`
4. Set up local development environment using `init.sh`

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch for each TODO item
2. Write tests before implementing functionality (TDD approach)
3. Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Run code quality checks before committing

### Priority Guidelines
- **Critical**: Must be completed for basic system functionality
- **High**: Required for production deployment
- **Medium**: Needed for robust production operation
- **Low**: Nice-to-have improvements and optimizations
